It's been a good movie month for me, and I've managed to nudge closer to my target of watching the [IMDb Top 250](http://www.imdb.com/chart/top).
But one tool I had in the past, that I sorely miss, is **twofifty.org**. It's a now-defunct site that kept track of the [IMDb Top 250](http://www.imdb.com/chart/top), and let you strike off the movies that you had watched. You could see which movies you hadn't seen, keep score, and discuss the movies.
Since it's demise, my movie watching slowed down as well.
Earlier this month, I set up a similar site at [250.s-anand.net](http://250.s-anand.net/). It has the same basic function. You can log in, strike out movies that you've seen, and keep track of what's left to see. For the more technically minded, the source-code is at [two-fifty.googlecode.com](http://two-fifty.googlecode.com/).

[Visit 250.s-anand.net](http://250.s-anand.net/)

[Happy movie tracking](http://250.s-anand.net/), and looking forward to your suggestions.

  www.whatshouldireadnext.com is similar, but a lot more customized. For books.
- **S Anand** _4 Feb 2009 2:28 pm_:
  Welcome, Sacha. Enjoy!
- **SMG** _5 Feb 2009 7:53 am_:
  check out this site...\
  http://www.listsofbests.com/\
  You can track a lot of lists out there
- **S Anand** _5 Feb 2009 1:58 pm_:
  Pretty neat. Looks like a site I'm likely to use quite a bit going forward.\
  Thanks, SMG!
- **Pramod Singh** _6 Feb 2009 8:54 pm_:
  Thanks dude !!! I used to track movies on twofifty.org and sorely missed it since it went down. Now I can keep track of them again and complete my mission of watching all of the top 250 movies. Great work !!!
- **Thejesh GN** _29 Jan 2009 6:43 am_:
  Awesome.\

  Can you just print the name and not email ids of "Top movie watchers"..
- **S Anand** _29 Jan 2009 9:39 am_:
  That's next on my to-do list :-)
- **Binny V A** _29 Jan 2009 2:55 pm_:
  Wow - I did not know others where [as crazy as me](http://blog.binnyva.com/2007/08/imdbs-250-movies/) ;-)\

  And thanks for the app - it will come in handy. Until know, I was using a text file - I just deleted the movies I saw.
- **S Anand** _30 Jan 2009 9:48 am_:
  Yeah, it was a bit of a shock to me as well ;-)
- **Sacha** _4 Feb 2009 1:46 am_:
  THANK YOU! It really sucks that twofifty.org went offline, but it’s awesome that you created a replacement.
- **Mofette** _21 Feb 2009 5:08 am_:
  Oh My God
  I think I love you! And they shut down just after I donated. Gits.
- **John Baptist** _8 Mar 2009 11:37 am_:
  Cheers, I too miss twofifty.org - going to be quite a chore ticking them all off again!
  Does your site (like twofifty.org) also 'remember' movies that have been ticked off but temporarily fall out of the top250 list?
- **[S Anand](http://www.s-anand.net/)** _8 Mar 2009 4:03 pm_:
  Yes, John, the 250.s-anand.net remembers moves that have fallen out of the Top 250 list. It also lets you know which movies have recently moved into the Top 250, and whether you'd marked them as seen.
- **Al** _24 Mar 2009 6:03 am_:
  Awesome, thank you.
- **Michael** _17 Mar 2009 3:33 am_:
  Thank you! I had toyed with writing something in Rails but I just didn't find the time. twofifty.org was a good site but it wasn't reliable at all.
- **[Tamlyn](http://tamlyn.org)** _28 May 2009 10:23 am_:
  Amazing. I was crestfallen when I saw twofifty.org had disappeared but your version is even better! Thanks so much for this. And i guess as it's Google-hosted, it's here to stay.
- **Sacha** _18 Aug 2009 4:57 pm_:
  I have to log in every single time I visit the list. Is that intended or a bug? It really sucks quite a bit.
- **[Himanshu](http://vidrohisvar.blogspot.com/)** _10 Aug 2009 9:45 am_:
  Thanks for the site.
  I was planning to do something similar since the day twofifty.org is down.
- **Brawler** _17 Sep 2009 9:50 pm_:
  http://www.icheckmovies.com seems very nice. Though is missing those codes you could use anywhere with html-code to track your count, and last 5 seen IMDb Top250 movies...
  Even that, I hope you'll like the site, it has more topics than Top250 ;)
- **[Limeworld.com &raquo; Blog Archive &raquo; IMDB Top 250](http://www.limeworld.com/2007/03/18/imdb-top-250/)** _6 Dec 2009 1:12 am_ _(pingback)_:
  [...] mere 95/250. My list: http://twofifty.org/user/Limegirl/ Update: twofifty.org is now defunct, but a clever fellow has launched something [...]
- **[Stijn](http://aardling.com/)** _25 Nov 2012 2:28 pm_:
  Just noticed the Facebook app no longer exists. So, I signed up for your alternate version. Let's see what my score is... 106/250. Still a loooong way to go.
- **F** _14 Aug 2015 2:11 pm_:
  Hi, I really like the site but now i get a 404 when trying to access it. Is it permanently removed or just temporarily? If you don't plan to put it up again would you be interested in open sourcing the source code so i can continue to use your handy tool? :)
