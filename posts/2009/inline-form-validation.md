A List Apart's article on [Inline Validation](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/inline-validation-in-web-forms/) is one of the most informative I've read in a while — and it's backed by solid data.

Some useful lessons:

- Inline validation can reduce form completion time by 40%
- Use inline validations where the user doesn't know if they'll get it wrong (e.g. is a username available?). Don't use them if user knows the answer (e.g. their name)
- Validate on blur, not on keypress (it's distracting, and users [can't multitask](http://www.azarask.in/blog/post/you-cant-multitask/))

  maybe u should add some inline validation on your comments form, instead of the wordpress error page?
