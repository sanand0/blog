  Ho!!! WoW! What a feeling !! Got 15/15 !!
  No.12 was a real tough one. It was troubling that am not getting this song. Obviously one of those albums which we heard a lot in Tamil but not in Hindi. Original is always original.Rest of them were all cool.
  Great Job by Anand. Really enjoyed this one ! Real Good work buddy.
  Long Live ARR !!
