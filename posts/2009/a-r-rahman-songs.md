  Got 22 without struggling. The last three (5, 17, 25) gave me trouble. Got 5 after some humming along and for 17, somehow was stuck on a dubbed version of a hindi soundtrack till I got it. 25 was purely round robin :)
- **[Sriram](http://www.sriramajeyam.com)** _2 Mar 2009 7:09 pm_:

  Hey, Great man. Thanks for the quiz. We had a lot of fun doing it.
  By the way, the score is 23! :) What are 17 and 25? I'm totally stumped (but, most probably, I've never heard these pieces).

  Got all right :)
- **Asuthosh** _12 Mar 2009 7:08 am_:
  25/25 - some old Tamil ones were tricky. The trick is to continue the interlude forward in your mind and it will segue into the pallavi/charanam. Great stuff, thanks!
- **Rivjot** _12 Mar 2009 8:20 am_:
  Please make such quiz for Hindi interludes of Rahman as well. Enjoyed taking this one :)
- **[Amit](http://amit.chakradeo.net/)** _11 Mar 2009 8:41 pm_:

- **Prashanth Dappula** _12 Mar 2009 2:54 am_:

  Rahmaniac from Malaysian ARR fan club(Rahmania).....25 definitely......all these interludes sat in the subconscious for too long already......
- **[Rams](http://ramsrules.blogspot.com)** _13 Mar 2009 5:37 pm_:
  Yippeee.... 25/25 again... for a rahmaniac, it feels good to get them all....
- **Siddharth** _14 Mar 2009 5:53 am_:
  awesome..i've got 25/25..thanks anand...great compilation man...
- **Chandra** _14 Mar 2009 5:48 pm_:
  Hi... I too got 25/25. The last one was tough (had to listen to it 4 times), the 13th one was a bit tricky, and I was slightly lucky with the 16th (but caught it even as I was typing it)! Great compilation!! Thanks a lot!
- **[ANANDA CHETANA](http://gmail)** _15 Mar 2009 5:56 am_:
