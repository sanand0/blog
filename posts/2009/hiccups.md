This morning, I was watching an episode of [Finley the Fire Engine](http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/finleythefireengine/) in which one of the trucks had hiccups. Reminded me of this Calvin & Hobbes — especially Hobbes' remark in the second strip.

![HIC HIC HIC (hic) I have (hic) have (hic) I (hic) I have the (hic) the (hic) ... the hic (hic) the (hic) What is it? What do you have? A dollar?? A new comic book? What?? The (hic hic) I have (hic) the (hic) the hic (hic) the (hic) ... I love doing this.](http://picayune.uclick.com/comics/ch/1989/ch890417.gif)

![Help me (hic) get (hic) rid of (hic) these darn (hic) hic (hic) hiccups! How? (hic) Scare me. OK... Our oceans are filled with garbage, we've created a hole in the ozone that's frying the planet, nuclear waste is piling up without any safe way to get rid of it... (hic) I mean, SURPRISE me (hic). That doesn't?! Boy, you're cynical.](http://picayune.uclick.com/comics/ch/1989/ch890418.gif)

![Here. Drinking from the far side of the glass is supposed to cure hiccups. The (hic) far side of (hic) the glass? (hic) How do I (hic) do THAT? You have to bend your head way over. Oh (hic) I see. (hic) Thanks. Now I've got the hiccups AND water up my nose. I think most hiccup cures were really invented for the amusement of the patient's friends.](http://picayune.uclick.com/comics/ch/1989/ch890419.gif)

![These (hic) hiccups are driving me (hic) crazy. Eat a spoonful of sugar. That's supposed to help. I'll (hic) try anything. CRUNCH SMACK SMACK Well? Are you cured? (hic) Nope. I'd better (hic) eat some more.](http://picayune.uclick.com/comics/ch/1989/ch890420.gif)

![My hiccups are gone! They finally went away all by themselves! What a relief! AAUGHH! Did I scare you? Did I cure your hiccups? hic hic hic hic hic](http://picayune.uclick.com/comics/ch/1989/ch890421.gif)
