excerpt: Just set up meetings, then cancel them. You'll be doubly happy.
---

In my current thrust towards greater management responsibilities, I have discovered a mechanism for generating happiness.

I set up meetings on important topics. That makes me happy -- I'm driving something useful.

Often, the meeting gets cancelled. That makes me happy -- I've more free time.

It's the perfect perpetual motion machine.
