Here's a good reason for me not to advertise my website. Here's a site on [time travel anamolies](http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:P0G0dSp3T-UC:www.geocities.com/Area51/Rampart/6040/) in films, which is [not accessible](http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Rampart/6040/), thanks to Yahoo's restrictions on data transfer. One listing on Metafilter probably killed the site.

But then, the question probably is, is that a reason to hate Yahoo?
