[Distributed Proofreaders](http://texts01.archive.org/dp/). As the name suggests, it's a distributed web-based tool for proof-reading books for Project Gutenberg. References from Slashdot and kuro5hin have spiked the number of pages proofread. But even that apart, they're targetting over 1,000 pages a day. That's over a book a day!
