[Google webquotes](http://labs.google.com/cgi-bin/webquotes) lets you see what other sites say about each of Google's search results. This is such a useful feature to me (at no incremental pain) that I see no reason to ever Google without webquotes! (Google also has [Google viewer](http://labs.google.com/gviewer.html), which to me is far less useful. And while you're at it, may as well check Google's [extensive resource for webmasters](http://www.google.com/webmasters/)) [via Kiruba](http://www.kirubashankar.com)
