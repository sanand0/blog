A [Google blog](http://google.blogspace.com/). And while we're on the subject, I've found Google labs' [glossary](http://labs.google.com/glossary) very useful. So are some [Google applications](http://www.soapware.org/directory/4/services/googleApi/applications) based on their API. (Incidentally, their server is overloaded. I tried getting a key yesterday, put it politely declined.)
