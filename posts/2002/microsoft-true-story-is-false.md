[Microsoft's 'true story' of a Mac-to-PC convert isn't true](http://www.plastic.com/article.html?sid=02/10/15/18451104). The "convert" works in a Public relations firm hired by Microsoft. And probably didn't switch in the first place. (The [original ad](http://216.239.53.100/search?q=cache:JmwQcVoG-ucJ:www.microsoft.com/insider/opsystems/windowsxp_setup.asp+http://+www.microsoft.com+/+insider+/+opsystems+/+windowsxp_setup.asp&hl=en&ie=UTF-8))
