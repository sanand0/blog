I didn't realise I could send/receive mails on my mobile ([BPL mobile](http://www.bplmobile.com/pgs/services/bby.html)). So I have yet another e-mail ID now @bplmobile.com -- and I can send e-mails too! I've integrated that with [MSN messenger](http://mobile.msn.com), so I can chat via SMS. (OK, not really. Lead time is in the order of several seconds.)
