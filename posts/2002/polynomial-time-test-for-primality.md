Prof. Manindra Agarwal and his students at IIT-K have figured out a [polynomial time test for primality](http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/news/primality.html). It was an [unsolved problem](http://www.vacets.org/articles/primality.html). The RSA algorithm assumes that this is impossible. ([NYTimes](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/08/science/08MATH.html))

Of course, [others](http://www.meganet.com/news/press/pressrelease12-30-98.htm) have claimed the same. To my knowledge, none is conclusively proven.

What if they're true? Well, in a few years, our cryptography algorithms will be useless. So it's back to the drawing board, with security-related dot-coms from Univs popping up.
