[Meg](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/javascript/2002/08/12/megnut.html) calls for professional blogging. I agree. Like all good things, blogging will have to go commercial, and like Faraday said, "... someday you can tax it." (Note: Actually, Faraday [didn't say it](http://198.64.129.160/quotes/faraday.htm).)
