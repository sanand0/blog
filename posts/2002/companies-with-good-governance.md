The STAR exchange is a stock exchange listing companies with [good governance](http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/article_abstract.asp?ar=1215&L2=18&L3=28&srid=27). That's a good criterion to list by, given the accounting we read about. This exchange has managed to outperform the conventional counterpart (Borsa), BTW.
