Broad and insightful talk by Diamond on [why history unfolded differently across continents](http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/diamond/diamond_p1.html). Note that he's talking about **why** and not **how**. Based on his book: [Guns, Germs and Steel](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0393317552/?tag=sanand-20).
