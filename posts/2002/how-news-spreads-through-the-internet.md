Staci Kramer interviewed the CEO of Turner Broadcasting (who, among other things, said stuff like not watching ads is theft). Staci traces how news of this [spread through the Internet](http://www.ojr.org/ojr/kramer/1022087318.php) into sites like [top 10 copyright crimes](http://research.yale.edu/lawmeme/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=198) and "[But Daddy I need to go](http://www.onegoodmove.org/1gm/1gmarchive/000101.html)".
