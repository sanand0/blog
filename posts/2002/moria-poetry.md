The first link I found on Google when searching for "Moria" was [Moria poetry](http://www.moriapoetry.com/). Now, Moria is this [text-based game](http://www.piratehaven.org/~beej/moria/) that I used to play until day-before. I like it. I don't like poetry. Still, I gave it a shot, and before long, I [read stuff like](http://www.moriapoetry.com/stephens.html)

> "Buffa in the seria\
> of my sights split infinitive sunrise\
> cicadas and more cicadas."

Sounds [Vogon](http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/hitchhikers/vogonpoetry/lettergen.shtml). No offence meant. But the only poetry I've enjoyed till date is Alice's [The Mouse's Tail](http://www.cs.rice.edu/~ssiyer/minstrels/poems/600.html).
