Remember the Oracle of Google? Looks like it's a lot more versatile than I thought. I asked it who coined the word "robot". And [the Oracle picked the right answer despite a mis-spelling!](http://www.mycgiserver.com/servlet/Morat.GoogleTest?question=Who+coined+the+word+%22robot%22%3F&allowstore=yes&answers=Capec&answers=Asimov&answers=Susan+Calvin&answers=Knuth). (The answer is Karl Capek)
