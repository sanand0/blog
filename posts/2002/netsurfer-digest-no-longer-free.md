Pity... Netsurfer's Digest now [costs $20 a year](http://www.netsurf.com/why_subs.html). They'd been hinting about it for a while. I'd probably pay for it, if there weren't alternatives. I find myself using them less, and substitutes like [Metafilter](http://www.metafilter.com) are pretty good too.
