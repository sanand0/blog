Oh, so [Sam Palmisano made CEO of IBM](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/31/business/media/31ADCO.html?ex=1036645200&en=3b897b998085ac9f&ei=5007). Guess that was expected. He wants to focus on on-demand computing (his word for corporatising distributed computing projects).

> Shortly, there will be companies creating this [distributed computing] market -- focusing on aggregating the retail computing power, and using them across several projects. (Google is already trying to do that through its [toolbar](http://toolbar.google.com/), and so is [Intel](http://www.intel.com/cure/).)
