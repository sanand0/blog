[Daypop is out of disk space](http://www.daypop.com/). Poor thing! Could we lend it some? I mean, could sites like Daypop work out a distributed architecture, using [web services](http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2002/08/28/wsdc.html)? Or using things like [space drives](http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2002/08/28/space.html)? [via Scripting News](http://www.scriptingnews.com)
