A little [article on anti-neutrino behaviour](http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993163). All very fine, except for a line towards the end:

> The oscillations are a result of the neutrinos having slightly different masses, ...

Since when did neutrinos start having mass!? (OK, it was in [July 98](http://physicsweb.org/article/world/11/7/3). And no one even told me!)
