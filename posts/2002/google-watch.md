[Google-watch](http://www.google-watch.org/) is against Google, because they're unfair, and don't respect privacy (via [Salon](http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2002/08/29/google_watch/index.html)). I still don't mind, as long as I get good search results. But this "unfair" part I kind-of agree with. Wish Google would search recently updated sites better. And they've also got a point about the ordering. Sometimes, I **would** like to see the "less important" (low pagerank) sites on top.
