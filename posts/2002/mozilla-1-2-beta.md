I downloaded [Mozilla 1.2 beta](http://www.mozilla.org). It loads fast. It runs fast. It hasn't crashed. It's tab feature is great. It's Type Ahead Find feature is fabulous. It's [add-ons](http://www.mozdev.org) are great. I think I'm going to switch browsers again! (My only crib, though, is that I can't customize keyboard shortcuts. Or I don't know how yet.)
