Interesting thought-piece by The Economist on how [bankruptcy laws may be hurting America](http://www.economist.com/business/displayStory.cfm?story_id=1317912). The logic is, industries with excess capacity have bankruptcies. The bankruptcy restores a balance. If courts help bankrupt companies shed debt and re-enter business, excess capacity again results. Leading to bankruptcies again.
