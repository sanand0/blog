The [stock market falls when the Parliament is in session](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow.asp?artid=17793284). Particularly if the Budget is discussed. Personally, I would attribute it to investor over-optimism. I don't see how the politicians take bad decisions more than half the time, because in that case, we're better off without them.

Hmm...
