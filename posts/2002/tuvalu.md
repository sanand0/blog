[Tuvalu is a small country](http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/tv.html) with 11,000 people. It's highest peak is under 5 metres. (Yes, metres.) It pretty much gets submerged every year. Incidentally, it's also the home of the .tv domain name. [via Maltesh](http://maltesh.blogspot.com/2002_11_17_maltesh_archive.html#84698551)
