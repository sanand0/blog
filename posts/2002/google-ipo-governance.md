Very [interesting article on Google](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.01/google_pr.html) on Wired. One interesting point the article raises towards the end is this: "As a private company, Google has one master: users. As a public company, there are shareholders to worry about." And the interests of these may not be aligned. Shareholders may want more ad revenues. Users do not want ads. Shareholders may want paid placements. Users do not. Once Google IPOs, I suspect its quality will fall.
