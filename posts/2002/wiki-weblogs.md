[Wiki Weblogs](http://www.ourpla.net/cgi-bin/pikie.cgi?WikiWeblogs). This is a feature that I could use. You can have a weblog organised around dates (or whatever), **and** around keywords. Several blogs already use this. Question: how should I transition from my (currently 100% manual) blog to one of these?
