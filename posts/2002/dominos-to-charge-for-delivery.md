Domino's Pizza is trying to [charge for delivery](http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/08/10/pizza.delivery.ap/index.html). But I thought the whole point of Domino's was to deliver pizza, as opposed to eating it "there". They may as well hike the price -- which is what this effectively translates to.

Speaking of which, I ordered a Deep Dish with jalapenos, tomato and onion a couple of weeks ago. I really liked it. When I called Domino's yesterday, they remembered the order and delivered it within 10 minutes. Impressive.

Oh, and their spelling of Indian locations sucks. Spot Adheri (W), Ahmadabad, Banglore, Hyderbad and Maylapore at their [locator](http://www.dominos.com/dominos_pizza/contact.nsf/frmIntlLocator).
