Ever since I started using NewsIsFree.com, I manage to run through my morning news much faster. Now, I'm trying to use some of these [RSS newsreaders](http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/story/0,3605,781838,00.html) to see if they can speed it up even further. (Note: Though I read news faster, I've ended up spending **more** time on it, not less!)
