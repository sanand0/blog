The strong linkage between [Google and blogs](http://www.corante.com/microcontent/articles/googleblog.shtml) can lead to subversions like [Googlebombing](http://www.uber.nu/2001/04/06/) ([more](http://www.corante.com/microcontent/articles/googlebombs.shtml")). The Church of Scientology is [already using it](http://operatingthetan.com/google/).

Speaking of which, my weblog archive got a fair number of hits from the Google search for [imdbpro password](http://www.google.com/search?q=imdbpro+password). I wondered why. Turns out that my archive joins IMDBPro and Metafilter as the only page that mentions the words IMDBPro and password!
