Cool picture of a [virtual keyboard](http://www.technologyreview.com/articles/wo_fitzgerald111902.asp). The article talks about a purely optical keyboard. You move your fingers, and the "keyboard" detects what you're typing. Now, if optics are that advanced, they should be able to figure out what I'm **writing** and put that on the computer. So I won't need a digital pad -- I'll just write on paper. Or even better, project the screen! Then I'll just carry a little 1" x 1" x 1" box that'll project a virtual screen that I can draw / write on.
