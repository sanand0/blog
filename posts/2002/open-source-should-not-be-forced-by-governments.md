[Open source should not be forced by governments](http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,55354,00.html), argues the [Initiative for Software Choice](http://www.softwarechoice.org/). Their argument (which open source proponents agree with) is that software should be chosen on merit. But the argument is also self-serving, as the initiative is funded by software companies.
