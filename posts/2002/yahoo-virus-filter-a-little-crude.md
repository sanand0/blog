Yahoo's been filtering e-mail viruses. Good, but they've been [a little crude](http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_2138000/2138014.stm). So a Google search for [medireview](http://www.google.com/search?q=medireview) reveals a book on [Middle Ages: that **medireview** chronology](http://www.st-francis-lutheran.org/nyt_11Mar01.html), and a [treasure ride](http://www.tuscany-adventures.com/Medieval.htm) with medireview jewels, a medireview city and medireview treasures.
