[ABC News managed to smuggle uranium](http://www.salon.com/ent/wire/2002/09/06/uranium/index.html) into the US. Reminds of when [George Stalk](http://www.fastcompany.com/online/22/digitime.html) was talking about the security checks in India being much tighter than in the US. He was body-frisked twice, and barely escaped a third random check.
