The Economist argues that in making 'ethical practices' and 'social responsibility' prominent, [corporates create a vicious cycle of guilt-until-proven-innocent](http://www.economist.com/business/displayStory.cfm?story_id=1454728). I agree with that part. But I wonder if the incentives in companies are aligned to benefit all stakeholders. Sure, in the long-run, everything is factored into the stock price. But the short (not even the medium) run is what managers need worry about, given the dynamic job market.
