A quick round-up on the Indian bloggers' lists:

- [Anita's list](http://indianbloggers.blogspot.com/): 103 blogs. Comprehensive (static)
- [Anita's ring](http://t.webring.com/hub?ring=indianbloggersri&id=6&hub): 47 blogs. Big, collaborative
- [Eatonweb](http://portal.eatonweb.com/country/India): 41 blogs. Collaborative, growing
- [Kamat's list](http://www.kamat.org/community/): 34 blogs. Flexible (moderated)

Other methods like [Blogchalk India](http://www.daypop.com/search?q=blogchalk+india) yield too few hits. If you want to go beyond these lists, Google searches like [indian blogger](http://www.google.com/search?q=indian+blogger) are probably your best bet.
