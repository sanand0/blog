Good article on [how Google Answers works](http://www.infotoday.com/searcher/oct02/west.htm). Unfortunately, the guy who wrote it was [fired from Google Answers](http://www.librarian.net/surreal.shtml). (Incidentally, this [Fortune article](http://www.fortune.com/indext.jhtml?channel=print_article.jhtml&doc_id=209291) mentions that Google makes over $100 mn a year. That's incredible!) [via GoogleBlog](http://google.blogspace.com)

> 'A frequent visitor' wrote in asking if I meant 'guy' as in 'guy or girl', because the person who wrote it is a girl. I **didn't** know that. Thanks! (Wonder if that re-inforces the stereotype of the female librarian...)
