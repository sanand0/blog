[Does education really pay?](http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2002/1125/124.html?_requestid=134) An interesting article on Forbes arguing that education does not **cause** higher salaries, but is merely correlated with it. The logic sequence is broadly:

- Labour markets want smart people.
- Smart people tend to want education.
- Hence labour markets appear to want educated people.
