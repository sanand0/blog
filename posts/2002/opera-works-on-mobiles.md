[Opera works well with mobile phones](http://rss.com.com/2100-1023-961831.html?type=pt&part=rss&tag=feed&subj=news). I don't understand how, personally, but [Opera has revamped its site](http://www.opera.com/products/smartphone/?session=) focusing on smartphones, and seems to have a good technology here.
