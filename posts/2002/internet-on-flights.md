Insight from a NY Times article on how the [Internet can be accessed from flights](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/08/travel/08rep.html): the reason you shouldn't use a laptop on a flight during take-off and landing is not because of electrical interference; it is that the laptop could be a dangerous loose flying object in case of turbulence. Now, that makes more sense.
