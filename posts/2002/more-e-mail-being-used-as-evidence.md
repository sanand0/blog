[More e-mail being used as evidence](http://rss.com.com/2100-1023-957779.html?type=pt&part=rss&tag=feed&subj=news). This time, by the evil RIAA against Morpheus and Kazaa. I wonder if this goes against some legal principle? Aren't you supposed to say, "Anything you say can be used against you?" Reminds me of 'American Beauty', in which Ricky agrees to kills Jane's parents on video.
