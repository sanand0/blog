An interesting legal conundrum. When Nike was accused of running sweatshops in Asia, it responded with press releases and ads claiming that it did not. Marc Kasky filed a case saying that [Nike was advertising unfairly](http://www.economist.com/business/displayStory.cfm?story_id=1494838), and won. Now corporates are raising the question of whether corporate statements are free speech, and can be similarly protected.
