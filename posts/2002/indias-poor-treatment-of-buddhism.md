We keep hearing about India's and Hindu's peaceful history. But if [India's poor treatment of Buddhism](http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/history/0,6121,800290,00.html) is anything to go by, we're no better than any others. Guess we were lucky to have Gandhi and a non-overthrowable British Government. Otherwise, we'd have gone to war as well.
