I found this site on [neuroscience (for kids)](http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/neurok.html). Nice. Has lots of brain games (no -- not smart ones -- more like testing your reaction time, etc.) Actually I was reading up on neuroscience because of this article on [how neuroscience helped figure out the meaning behind a Zen garden](http://www.nature.com/nsu/020923/020923-8.html). [via missing matter](http://missingmatter.net/article.pl?sid=02/09/27/0225233)
