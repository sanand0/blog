[Tomorrow's leaders: opinion on IIT/IIM grads](http://www.business-standard.com/archives/2002/oct/50051002.049.asp) by T N Ninan at Business Standard. From his interviews for the Aditya Birla scholarships, and observes that there is a lack of awareness about India among them, and that the real value of the IITs/IIMs is in the selection process, not the education. I disagree on the latter. I think the 4+2 years of intense competition also adds value. The curriculum, however, may or may not.
