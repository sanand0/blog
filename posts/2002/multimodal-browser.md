IBM has this cool tool: [Multimodal browser extension](http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/aw.nsf/FAQs/mmbextension). With this, I can create a textbox on my site, which you can fill in by speaking to the web page. The underlying standard is [W3C's XHTML+Voice](http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml+voice/).

Two years ago, I'd have downloaded it and had it on my site in a few hours. Today, I'm a married consultant. I don't have a few hours. :-(
