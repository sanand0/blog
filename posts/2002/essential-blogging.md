[Essential Blogging](http://www.oreillynet.com/cs/weblog/view/wlg/1440): a book on weblogging. Quite good. Technie note: This [RSS](http://www.voidstar.com/rssfaq) thing looks interesting. [Daypop has started](http://www.danchan.com/weblog/daypop/22514) offering RSS output. Need to see how I can use it.
