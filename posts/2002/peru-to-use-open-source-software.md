In June, [Peru decided](http://stacks.msnbc.com/news/770299.asp) to use open source software. Today, [California plans the same](http://news.com.com/2100-1001-949241.html?tag=fd_top). If governments catch on to this trend, and go further by enforcing suppliers to use compatible systems, it'd be a real big boost to open systems.
