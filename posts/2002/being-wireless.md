[Nicholas Negroponte on "Being Wireless"](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.10/wireless.html).

> Five years ago, I put a wireless LAN in my home in Boston. At the time it cost about $2,000 for the base station and $500 for each device I wanted to connect. Today, it costs $120 and $50, respectively, and the price is dropping.

That's about Rs. 10,000. My next gadget is identified.
