[India in the eyes of Al Beruni](http://www.infinityfoundation.com/ECITalberunindiaframeset.htm), an Arabic historian around 1000AD. It is interesting to note the reversal of several customs among Hindus and Muslims. Particularly that "In all consultations and emergencies they [Hindus] take advice of the women."
