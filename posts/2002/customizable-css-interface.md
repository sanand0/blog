[AllTheWeb's Alchemist: customizable CSS interface](http://www.alltheweb.com/alchemist/). Possibly the first non-Google search-engine innovation I've seen in a few years. AllTheWeb lets you customise the look and feel of your search results. It looks quite flexible, but I wonder how much the interface will be constrained by the bounds of Cascading Style Sheets itself. Google's API may end up being the truly customizable interface. [via andersja](http://www.jacobsen.no/anders/blog/archives/2002/10/15/alltheweb_vs_google.html)
