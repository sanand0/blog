An article in the Scientific American [linking two-leggedness, non-vegetarianism and our brain size](http://www.sciam.com/print_version.cfm?articleID=0007B7DC-6738-1DC9-AF71809EC588EEDF). Contrast that with this (funny) [talk.origins post on the trade-off between a large brain and two-leggedness](http://www.talkorigins.org/origins/postmonth/may02.html).
