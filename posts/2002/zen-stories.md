[Zen stories](http://www.rider.edu/users/suler/zenstory/zenstory.html). Read some of these first in Douglas Hofstader's Godel, Escher, Bach. Searched for a collection for a long time. This looks like quite a comprehensive one. If you want a flavour of these, [Zen Master Gutei](http://www.rider.edu/users/suler/zenstory/gutei.html)'s story is one of those bizarre ones.
