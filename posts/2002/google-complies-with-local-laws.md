Now [Google is complying with local laws](http://news.com.com/2100-1023-963132.html) by eliminating anti-Semetic sites from their French (google.fr) and German (google.de) sites. These sites still remain accessible through google.com, though.

> In the long run, I don't think this state of affairs will continue. I hope we have one law across the world, at least where the Net is concerned. But more likely is an agreement on law guidelines, something like the WTO. Less likely and desirable is where tracking surfers' country of origin becomes reliable.

Besides, [Google has lots of other complaints to take care of](http://www.chillingeffects.org/search.cgi?search=google). [via Plastic](http://www.plastic.com/article.html?sid=02/10/24/17230327)
