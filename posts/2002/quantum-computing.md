Quantum computing takes steps forward. First, we improve our storage ability with [1000 bits in 1 molecule](http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993129). Then we [perform](http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993114) the [Grover algorithm](http://alumni.imsa.edu/~matth/quant/473/473proj/node9.html) using molecules. Now, all that's needed is a good set of problems to solve.
