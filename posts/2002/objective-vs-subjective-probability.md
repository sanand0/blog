[Determinism, Chaos and Quantum Mechanics](http://dogma.free.fr/txt/JB-Determinism.pdf) [PDF]. Interesting 30-pager by Jean Bricmont. He begins by differentiating predictability from determinism, and proceeds to explain how chaos theory **supports** determinism by enhancing predictability.

As an interesting aside, Bricmont's article points out that there are 2 kinds of probabilities. **Objective probability** is where I **know** that if I toss a fair coin enough times, it'll turn up heads 50% of the time. **Subjective probability** is where I think there's a 10% chance it'll rain tomorrow, and I don't care to repeat the event. The former is an informed statement about a system. The latter is our best guess about an event. The former number is a constant, if we've done the calculations right. The latter number can change as our knowledge of the event increases.

  [...] Tips can be both objective and subjective. To get success and profit you must be a good and skilful observer. The historical data that you have will help you to set up a plan. You must keep records of goals scored by your player or team. All you need is to understand the complexity of the game. If you go for harder practice you will become an expert. [...]
