[Vivisimo](http://vivisimo.com/), a document clustering service. As far as I can understand, it collects data from multiple sources and clusters it into hierarchies. Automatically. Sounds good, and seems to work reasonably well on Net searches too. At the very least, it's a fresh way of searching. via Markose
