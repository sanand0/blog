Some people [petitioned](http://www.petitiononline.com/twotower/) that "The Two Towers" (sequel to "Fellowship of the Ring") was named after the World Trade Centre. Curiously, this petition has a far larger number of votes compared to its [counter-petition](http://www.petitiononline.com/trutower/).
