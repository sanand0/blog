Read about the guy who hacked phones by [whistling a perfect 2600Hz tone](http://netsecurity.about.com/library/weekly/aa041299.htm) while watching the most intrusive ad format I've seen so far -- animations floating around in the background. This is the first ad that forced me to click on it. Result: I'm going to avoid such sites. I still like Google's concept: give ads only to those who ask for them -- and keep them seperate.
