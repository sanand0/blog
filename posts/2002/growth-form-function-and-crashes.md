[Growth, Form, Function, and Crashes](http://www.santafe.edu/sfi/publications/Bulletins/bulletinFall00/features/cosma.html): an article from the Santa Fe institute. It explains scale-free fairly well. The point is, scale-free networks have a few hubs. If you knock a hub out, the network is fragmented. But your chance of knocking a hub out by random is small, since there are so few of them. That makes scale-free networks reliable as well as vulnerable.

Slightly more technical details at [PhysicsWeb](http://physicsweb.org/article/world/14/7/09) by the creators of scale-free networks. It also says that if you **design** a network, it may not be scale-free. But if you **let it evolve**, it probably will be.
