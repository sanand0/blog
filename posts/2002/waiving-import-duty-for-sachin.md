[Waiving import duty for Sachin's Ferrari](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow.asp?art_ID=22005228) is kicking up a controversy. Fair enough. The smartest thing I see Sachin do is drive it for a while, and auction it for charitable purposes. Announcing, of course, his intentions beforehand.
