**Update: There used to be an unflattering (Photoshopped) picture of [Amitabh Mall](http://in.linkedin.com/pub/amitabh-mall/0/56/671) here. It's been taken down on request.**

I got a [digital camera](http://home.fujifilm.com/products/digital/digitalcamera/fx2600z/). Here's a snap from it.

Now, you may be wondering why the snap looks bad. That's not true. Meet Amitabh, friend and colleague. Looks a little different. Unfortunately balding early. After all, he's a consultant. Currently unsatisfied with the object of his attention (either the food or me) to the extreme. Following a unique love-life model.
