[distributed.net cracked RC5-64](http://www.distributed.net/pressroom/news-20020926.html). RC5-64 is an [encryption algorithm developed by RSA](http://www.rsasecurity.com/news/releases/pr.asp?doc_id=1400). It took 4 years. It looks long. But the big deal is, the algorithm therefore can't be used for long-term security. More importantly, it's becoming practical to use distributed computing on a massive scale.
