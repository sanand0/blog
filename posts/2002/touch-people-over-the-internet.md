You can hear people over the Internet. You can see people over the Internet. Now [you can touch people over the Internet](http://news.zdnet.co.uk/story/0,,t269-s2124692,00.html). When can we smell and taste them? Or are these senses too mundane to worry about? I, for one, would be very happy to be able to taste recipes online.
