Yahoo's [Buzz Game](http://buzz.research.yahoo.com/bk/market/index.html) tracks various technology markets, and lets people bet on which one will win. So, for instance, [C leads language](http://buzz.research.yahoo.com/bk/market/market.html?_mid=7440), [Livejournal leads blogs](http://buzz.research.yahoo.com/bk/market/market.html?_mid=1552), [Flickr leads tags](http://buzz.research.yahoo.com/bk/market/market.html?_mid=9744), and [Bittorrent leads P2P](http://buzz.research.yahoo.com/bk/market/market.html?_mid=6416).
