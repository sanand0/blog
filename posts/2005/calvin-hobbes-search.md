[Calvin and Hobbes search](http://users.rcn.com/dtweed/calvin/index.htm) from David Tweed. You can search for your favourite comics (mine are Tracer Bullet), note down the dates, and check them out on [ucomics](http://www.ucomics.com/calvinandhobbes/). (You need a subscription to view old comics.)

I've typed out the [quotes](/calvin/).
