Some interesting ads on Google video: [FotoPrix](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1804991734411445297): perfect pictures for an imperfect world. [Nike](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-99822590543142403) ad in Lisbon. [Honda](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1758564280154798806) car assembly (a classic). Google Video also has [Google Current](http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=google+current&lv=1), which is a newsreel about Google's top searches. But the find was a 5-hour [Google factory tour](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3383042311441257769).

  Thanks for your interest in Google Video.Currently, the playback feature of Google Video isn't available in your country.We hope to make this feature available more widely in the future, and we really appreciate your patience.

  That is truly a pity. Wonder if any of the proxys will take care of it...
