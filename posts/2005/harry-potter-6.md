I went to Waterstones at Oxford Street to see the release of [Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0439784549/?tag=sanand-20). There was a party the previous night, with all the fanfare associated with a previous night. But things seemed fairly quiet when I was there. The usual crowd at Oxford Street, and the usual crowd at Waterstones.

I already knew who dies in the sixth book. I couldn't help spotting it as I was reading some blog. Since the suspense was already spoilt, I opened to the last few pages, and ended up learning who the Half-Blood Prince was.
