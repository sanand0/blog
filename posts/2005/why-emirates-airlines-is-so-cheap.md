The Economist explains [why Emirates Airlines is so cheap](http://www.economist.com/printedition/displayStory.cfm?story_id=5093506). It's not just the Government subsidy. Zero tax, low interest rates (Government-backed), and low staff cost without unions. Apparantly, they are the only low-fare long-distance flyer.
