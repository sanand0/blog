When I use the URL <http://www.geocities.com/root_node/?200531> to view my site, it doesn't show the Yahoo! ad bar on the right. But when I use any other number, like <http://www.geocities.com/root_node/?200530>, or load it plain, like <http://www.geocities.com/root_node>, it doesn't work. I suspect the 200531 is related to today's date (2005 Mar 31), that it changes every day, and that this feature is used by one of Firefox's ad blockers.

  Hey, your search searches the html.

  It does use dates. On April 1, I have to use 20051 instead of 200531

  Yes, Jetru -- the search box does a regular expression search of all HTML
