I need to get used to the British way of responding with "No" when they really agree with you. For example, in response to "The weather's not looking good," I would say "Yeah." The British say "No." (No, it isn't.) It's a bit jarring -- feels like they're disagreeing. For instance,

> "London isn't expensive."\
> "No." (what? you're saying it's expensive?)

> "I don't have a ticket."\
> "No." (what? you're telling me I **have** a ticket?)

> "There's not enough room."\
> "No."

etc. Quite disorienting. I guess it's also a little more hard work. You have to keep track of when to say "Yes" and when to say "No".

  All three questions seem to suggest a negative property. COuld it be that they are saying "No?" as a way of confirming your observation?

  I meant so start with 'All three observations..."..

  I think now itâ€™s the time to teach them back, what we learned from them.
