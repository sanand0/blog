  How do you get to all these amazing links?
- **S Anand** _29 Jul 2005 6:01 am_:
  Mainly using [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/) these days.
- **Arun** _29 Jul 2005 2:30 pm_:
  Ah, okie... But there is so much crap there...You are darn good at filtering stuff then! :-)
- **Arun** _29 Jul 2005 2:36 pm_:
  btw, dunno if it's a bug, but there is a problem with the cursor in this text book. If I leave the page and return to the text box after i start typing, am not able to get the cursor to refocus on the text box. It just disappears. In firefox.

  Update the placement section also
- **RaM** _29 Jul 2005 4:44 pm_:
  Your Placement Section is static. Pls Update it. Your search tactics are very good
- **Dhar** _30 Jul 2005 5:28 am_:
  Arun, I too have had that problem with the cursor.
- **Howie** _30 Jul 2005 7:56 am_:
  few links are dead in Placement section
- **S Anand** _31 Jul 2005 9:07 pm_:
  Could you give me a step-by-step regarding the cursor problem? I couldn't reproduce it.
- **Dhar** _2 Aug 2005 2:50 pm_:
  http://digg.com/spy has an excellent collection of whacky/interesting links. And they use Ajax too. Another nice place to pick up good interesting posts.
