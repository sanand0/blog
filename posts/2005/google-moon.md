[Google Moon](http://moon.google.com/). At the highest magnification, the moon is made of cheese. At the lowest, the moon is rectangular. But it apparantly isn't a prank.

  Interesting - Just drag the zoom to max and leave it there. The picture colour changes. Wonder why...

  The idea is to show that the moon is made of cheese... Kinda easter egg thingy.
