I installed [Google Desktop Search 2](http://desktop.google.com/). The best part is "search as you type". It also introduces a sidebar showing e-mail, RSS feeds, news, photos, popular searches, etc. The indexing is much faster too. (I take that back. Indexing is as slow as ever.)

  I did the same. But fortunately, it's finished indexing within 48 hours (with lots of breaks).
