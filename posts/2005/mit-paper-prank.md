MIT pulls a [prank on the World Multi-Conference on Systemics](http://www.cnn.com/2005/TECH/science/04/14/mit.prank.reut/index.html) by submitting a computer-generated paper titled "Rooter: A Methodology for the Typical Unification of Access Points and Redundancy". I was among the people spammed by Nagib Callaos, the organizer of the conference.

> The students were soliciting cash donations so they could attend the conference and give what Stribling billed as a "completely randomly-generated talk, delivered entirely with a straight face." They exceeded their goal, with $2,311.09 cents from 165 donors.
