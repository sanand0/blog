[Google Maps](http://maps.google.com/). Only has the US for now. But that may change, given that

> not to mention that google has been primarily focused on the u.s. market and is now turning their full attention to the global marketplace.

The interface, as always with Google, is fantastic. This is the way to go for Web applications.

  Actually, google maps produced better routes too (more intuitive or just plain luck in my case ) but 2 consecutive routes cant be coincidence

  Their database may be from Keyhole, whom they acquired recently. I didn't see anything from India on it, though.
