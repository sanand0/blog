[Charade](http://www.archive.org/details/charade) starring Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant is now in public domain (you can download it for free). So are some other classics like [His Girl Friday](http://www.archive.org/details/his_girl_Friday) and [Dressed to Kill](http://www.archive.org/details/dressed_to_kill). See [Archive.org's feature films](http://www.archive.org/details/feature_films). (Actually, it's not a Hitchcock film. But it's said to be the [best Hitchcock film Hitchcock never made](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charade).)

  [...] can easily be mistaken for an Alfred Hitchcock film. With wit to spare, the presence of Gary Grant and an innocent [...]
