I met Leonard Payne, [The Priest](http://www.leonard-payne.com/blog/?p=19), [Andrea Casalotti](http://www.velorution.biz/) and Scott Caplan at the [London Marketing Soiree](http://perfectpath.co.uk/wiki/index.php/London_Marketing_Soiree_July_11th_2005). Quite a diverse bunch of people. Leonard quoted Seth Godin on something neither he nor I will never forget.

> They say, if a website is well designed, people will find what they want. That's not true. Think of the visitors as monkeys, wearing a 'Big Red Fez', going itchy on the keyboard. What's the **one** thing on the monkey's mind?
>
> Where's the banana!?
