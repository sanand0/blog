[WinAmp 5.1 leaked](http://www.fluxiontech.com/?p=69). Actually, the features were. The good part is, we will have 8X CD ripping in the free version, and ability to create WMA files. Wonder how the Predixis Smart Playlist Generator works. (It says "Mix your tracks based on what they sound like!")

  Jet Audio too does some mixing based on what they sound like. Let me see if I can dig up that data. On the other hand, why use WinAmp for ripping? DB-Power-Amp is the way to go. Allows you to rip in various formats and no restrictions on the ripping speed.
