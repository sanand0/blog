Hotbar threatened to sue Symantec over its anti adware software. Symantec filed back a [zero dollar lawsuit](http://informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=164301665) against Hotbar.

> "Until yesterday, adware and spyware makers could send out threatening letters with almost no downside," said Edelman as he put the Symantec court case into perspective. "Nothing bad would happen to them, and maybe something good would happen, maybe the anti-spyware vendor would give in and remove them from their database."
