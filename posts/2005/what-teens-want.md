[What Teens Want](http://mcmanus.typepad.com/grind/2005/10/web_20_what_tee.html). From a session at Web2.0.

> The big laugh line of the session was when Safa asked them how they'd go about researching information on a CD player they might want to buy. They looked at him in silent puzzlement, as if to say, "why would we buy a CD player?"
