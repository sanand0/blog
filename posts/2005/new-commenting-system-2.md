My new commenting system is based on the principle of "scribbling on the margin". If you're interested, have a look at the source code for this page. It is as clear as mud, so best of luck!

  Where do these comments get stored

  Nice commenting system. A couple of points though...It took me a while to figure out how to post the comment :). Maybe a note on that somewhere would help.. Also the text colour when I'm typing in the comment is almost invisible.

  I fixed those two. Is it OK? Anything else?
- **TOPFRAME** _1 Feb 2005 12:00 pm_:
  Good to see you back, Anand. :)
