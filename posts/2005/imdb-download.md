You can download an up-to-date copy of the [entire Internet Movie database](ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/misc/movies/database/), and use software like [MovieDb](http://homepages.paradise.net.nz/rhudson/software/moviedb.html) to view it remotely on your computer. My current project: watch the entire [top 250 films](http://www.imdb.com/top_250_films).

  Suppose I want to download the entire imdb site, will downloading everything from the link you have given also give images of the movies? Because without images, I don't know what the point is.\

  I came across another method to download imdb, as a TomeRaider (not Tombraider) ebook, and that is only 157 MB, so I am not sure if it contains images as well.
