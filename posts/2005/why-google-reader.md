I switched to [Google Reader](http://reader.google.com/) as my blog reader (I was using Mozilla so far). The reason was simple: speed. Thanks to the Google site's speed and keyboard navigation, I can read blog entries 10 times faster. Now **there's** a unique proposition for Google that a lot of people are missing: that their site loads a whole lot faster than others. It makes a huge difference to the whole browsing experience.
