Deep Throat is [FBI assistant director, Mark Felt](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/31/AR2005053100655.html). It's interesting that UIUC carried out a four-year investigation on Deep Throat's identity, and had concluded that Fred Fielding, Nixon's deputy counsel, was deep throat.
