[Google Local Business Center](http://www.google.com/local/add).

> Fill in the address of your business. Google matches with its database, and edit the category, hours, payment terms, etc.... of course it's not going to do this without some kind of validation. After you've submitted your listing Google will send you a letter within two weeks with a PIN and activation instructions for making your edits "live" on Google Local. Your listing won't be included on the site until this process is gone through.
