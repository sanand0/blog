Google Maps gets Edwin Soto [out of a traffic violation](http://www.gearlive.com/index.php/news/article/google_maps_helps_fight_traffic_tickets_07160942/). He was able to use his laptop and wi-fi connection at the court to show the judge that Cathedral Parkway, where he ran a red light, was a two-way street and not a one-way as the cop indicated.
