A few tips, without getting into the details. [Array formulas](http://www.google.com/search?q=excel+array+formulas) let you perform any calculation on an entire list, and get the result in a single formula. [Database functions](http://www.google.com/search?q=excel+database+functions+DSUM) like DSUM can manipulate tables of data very flexibly. Using these and [Pivot tables](http://www.google.com/search?q=excel+pivot+tables), you can do anything with any tabular data.

  I needed your feedback on www.doondo.org. Give it a spin let me know. I wanted to avoid positng here but never got any replies for the mails sent at root\_node at yahoo.com
- **Ananth** _22 Dec 2005 6:33 am_:
  www.doondo.org is a hobby project I've been working on. The beta is just out.
- **Ananth** _22 Dec 2005 6:35 am_:
  Looking forward for your views and feedback

  great concept ananth..shld be a hit considering the great response to a similar funda used in IIM-I's Klueless
- **S Anand** _22 Dec 2005 12:31 pm_:
  I liked the concept and interface, Ananth. Will mail you in detail. Quick question... how do I find out what the right keywords are?
- **ritzkini** _23 Dec 2005 2:19 am_:
  hehehe...hey anand,saw the visitor stats thing for the first time today ! awesomely cool ,kudos! u did it yourself ??
- **Dhar** _23 Dec 2005 3:26 am_:
  Ananth, does your game support advanced Google operators?
- **Ananth** _23 Dec 2005 4:11 am_:
  Thanks for feedback folks. doondo needs additional features, like game summary with right keywords. Right now only basic operators are supported. Even such a simple concept requires complex coding skills! I would love if you can post the suggestion at doondo@googlegroups.com. Great if you can join the group. Anand wouldn't like spamming his comments section with doondo.
- **S Anand** _24 Dec 2005 1:42 am_:
  Yeah ritzkini, spent a week coding the visitor stats. What else do you think would be useful to see?
- **ritzkini** _26 Dec 2005 7:22 am_:
