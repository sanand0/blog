[Total immersion](http://www.t-immersion.com/) has technology that lets you create real-time 3-D images on a video feed. It's more impressive to watch one of their [demos](mms://wm.networkworld-na-central.speedera.net/wm.networkworld-na-central/events/demo04/TotalImmer_pres.wmv).

  I think the demos link needs authorizations

  Strange... it seems to work fine for me. What error does it report?
