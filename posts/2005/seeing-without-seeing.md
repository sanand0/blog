[Esref Armagan, blind painter](http://www.newscientist.com/channel/being-human/mg18524841.700). He has been blind all his life. Yet his [paintings](http://www.mersina.com/gallery/armagan/paints.html) are realistic. Neural scans indicate that when he is painting, his visual cortex is stimulated as much as it is for normal people when they see objects.

  I would also mention the genius of evolution. If he can know things like perspective without ever having seen, it means that sort of thing is hard-coded in our brain!
