[Profile of the London bombers](http://www.news24.com/News24/World/Londonattacks/0,,2-10-1854_1736976,00.html). I hope their Pakistani origin does not create a backlash. But then, this is the UK. Not the US.

  Fixed the link. Thanks, Harish. And yes, I **have** heard about some incidents against Asians outside London. You are right.
