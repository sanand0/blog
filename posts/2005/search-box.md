I have introduced a "Search" box near the top. It searches for posts that contain the string (regular expression) you type in that box.

  Like he says, this is quite simple to do. But it makes the page more clutterred. Blogs have to be simple, and easy to read.. Kind of loses the purpose
- **Jetru** _26 Mar 2005 5:14 pm_:
  No I like this format, except for the Permalink button
- **S Anand** _28 Mar 2005 3:17 am_:
  Yeah, I don't like the Permalink button either. Any suggestions?
