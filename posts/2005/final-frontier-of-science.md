[We are the final frontier](http://www.guardian.co.uk/life/feature/story/0,13026,1409019,00.html). The Guardian asks leading scientists what they think will be the next revolution in science. (It's almost a trend, spawning books like [The Next Fifty Years](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375713425/?tag=sanand-20).)

> First came the Copernican revolution in the 16th century. The Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus argued that the Earth was not at the centre of the solar system. Charles Darwin got personal more than 300 years later by implying that humans weren't special either. With the publication of On the Origin of Species, Darwin promoted his theory of evolution via natural selection. Nearly a century later, two Cambridge-based scientists, James Watson and Francis Crick, unravelled the structure of DNA. So what's next? What will be the fourth revolution?
