  Hi Anand...The six ways of reading a book for free link is not working. Can u pls reload the link
- **S Anand** _7 Jul 2005 4:45 pm_:
  Did I have a link like that? Where?
- **Ram** _8 Jul 2005 2:15 am_:
  Those who are using IE may get a false icon saying it as a broken link,but with Firefox it works fine
- **S Anand** _8 Jul 2005 5:44 am_:
  Guys, what link are you talking about!?
- **Anonymous Hero** _8 Jul 2005 7:22 am_:
  I am using Firefox but the link is not working Ram. Can you tell me how it worked for you?
- **S Anand** _8 Jul 2005 8:47 am_:
  If this is a hoax on me, it is the best I have seen so far!
- **Anonymous Hero** _8 Jul 2005 10:12 am_:
  From my side, yes... I saw the other two comments and thought to myself, "Mate, that looks like a nice way to pull a fast one on Anand' :-)
- **S Anand** _8 Jul 2005 10:59 am_:
  Well, seems like a day of hoaxes. I got a mail from a colleague in Finance asking me not to reclaim VAT. I never even tried!
- **Ram** _9 Jul 2005 3:44 pm_:
  From where can we get Free e-books ? If anyone knows please post it here or mail me
- **Dhar** _10 Jul 2005 1:58 am_:
  Depends on what kind of e-books you are looking for. If you want novels, you could check out http://www.greylib.align.ru/
- **S Anand** _10 Jul 2005 11:38 am_:
  The torrent network has plenty. Try the BitLord client.
- **Dhar** _11 Jul 2005 3:46 pm_:
  And the sites: torrentspy.com and thepiratebay.org/. What I like the most about thepiratebay is their response to legal threats (http://thepiratebay.org/legal.php)
- **Anonymous** _12 Jul 2005 9:41 am_:
  guess the link that was mentioned corresponds to the june 17th entry at http://www.geocities.com/root\_node/articles/London\_2005.html and mirc is a good place for ebooks.
- **S Anand** _12 Jul 2005 11:04 am_:
  Oh, OK.
