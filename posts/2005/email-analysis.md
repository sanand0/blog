Marc Eisenstadt has analysed [15 years of email](http://www.corante.com/getreal/archives/2005/02/11/eight_years_of_email_stats_pass_1.php).

> ... it is trivially easy to get to 2.5 hours per workday assuming a fairly ruthless, 'one-touch', knee-jerk email interaction regime. And worse if you deviate from the regime.

> Then there are other sources of workflow: blogs, aggregator summaries, phone calls (rare, but I still allow one or two), cell-phone, text message, instant messaging (my buddy list is very large, and most of them are work-related).

Interesting that [Knuth opted out of email](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/email.html) in 1990.
