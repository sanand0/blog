I end up changing my office laptops every year or so, and hence reinstall lots of software. Here's my inventory.

I **most certainly will** install the following.\
[ActivePerl](http://www.activestate.com/). I still program. I know Perl. I love Perl.\
[Acrobat Reader](http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html)\
[BitLord](http://www.bitlord.com/)\
[DivX player](http://www.divx.com/)\
[Dave's quicksearch deskbar](http://www.dqsd.net/)\
[Microsoft Office 2003](http://office.microsoft.com/). Has some really good improvements over Office 2000.\
[NoteTab Light](http://www.notetab.com/). Multiple tabs notepad. But is there anything better?\
[Nero Express](http://www.nero.com/)\
[Picasa 2](http://www.picasa.com/)\
[WinAmp](http://www.winamp.com/) (with [Media Library import/export](http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&threadid=155680#b4s))\
[WinRar](http://www.rarlab.com/)\
[WinZip](http://www.winzip.com/)

I **most likely will** install the following, but not necessarily.\
[Adobe Photoshop](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/main.html). Almost vital, but I can live with Microsoft Office Picture Manager.\
[Goldwave](http://www.goldwave.com/). I often record interviews, or give commentary for home-made movies.\
[Google Earth](http://earth.google.com/) (with [Fraps](http://www.fraps.com/)). To browse the world and make movies out of them.\
[Google Toolbar](http://toolbar.google.com/)\
[Mozilla Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/). For multi-tabbed browsing, mainly. Otherwise, IE is fine.\
[MSN Messenger](http://messenger.msn.com/). Just for the interface. Somehow, it feels "smoother" than Yahoo.\
[RealPlayer](http://www.real.com/player/). Don't listen to RealAudio that much. Still...\
[UnixUtils](http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/). I use "grep" and "less" more often than "dir"\
[VirtualDub](http://www.virtualdub.org/). For the occasional movie editing that Microsoft Movie Maker can't handle.\
[WinHtTrack](http://www.httrack.com/). To browse offline.\
[Google Desktop Search](http://desktop.google.com/). Helps remember my browsing history.

Tempting, but **no thanks**.\
[Opera](http://www.opera.com/). Mozilla's fine, thank you.\
[Yahoo Messenger](http://messenger.yahoo.com/). MSN Messenger's better, thank you.\
[Yahoo Desktop Search](http://desktop.yahoo.com/). Better interface than Google's. But no browsing history.

  Looks like bloglines has issues with showing the RSS of the post. Especially the list of programs. I get a blank list :(
- **Krishna** _20 Jul 2005 6:09 pm_:
  And a really nice way to show comments! I love it!
- **S Anand** _20 Jul 2005 7:44 pm_:
  Hope the RSS feed is fixed now. And thanks!
- **Dhar** _21 Jul 2005 1:11 am_:
  Does Winzip do something that Winrar doesnt?
- **Dhar** _21 Jul 2005 1:13 am_:
  No anti-virus software?Tipping my hat to you... You, sir, are a brave man! Try Avast, it is free and it is good!
- **Shiva** _21 Jul 2005 2:05 am_:
  'Digit ' One of the popular PC magazine rated it as the â€˜Bestâ€™, i tried it believe me after that my system had 50 Trojans and worms and my Laptop was badly affected
- **S Anand** _21 Jul 2005 4:52 am_:
  I just like WinZip's interface. As for anti-virus, believe it or not, yes, I am quite foolish on that front.
- **S Anand** _21 Jul 2005 4:55 am_:
  How's AVG? Heard it was good.
- **Krishna** _21 Jul 2005 7:11 am_:
  RSS Feed is fine now. Thanks!
- **Dhar** _21 Jul 2005 8:25 am_:
  Since I did not want to shell out loads of moolah, I just downloaded Avast to give it a shot. I have been pretty impressed by it since then. Another one you might want to give a shot is Clamwin (www.clamwin.com)
- **Dhar** _21 Jul 2005 10:37 am_:
  Are you able to run Bitlord from behind firewalls? Or do you use some kind of tunneling software? I have been unable to get bittorrent to work with tunnelling software. :(
- **S Anand** _21 Jul 2005 11:47 am_:
  Not behind a firewall, luckily.
- **A Karthik** _22 Jul 2005 4:33 pm_:
  jedit is good
- **S Anand** _22 Jul 2005 7:17 pm_:
  Hey, great to hear from you, Karthik! Will mail you.
- **Dhar** _25 Jul 2005 10:37 am_:
  Just saw that you will be installing DivX player. Why not give MPlayer or VLC a try. I personally love Mplayer.
- **sathish** _26 Jul 2005 4:05 am_:
  for editors, I have off late starting using ScitE editor.. It is pretty good with multiple tabs and coloring based on the language one uses for coding
- **Dhar** _26 Jul 2005 5:57 am_:
  Somehow I still prefer VIM for simple editing. I tried convincing people at work that I use LaTe X for all document preparation needs, but somehow it got shot down. :(
- **S Anand** _31 Jul 2005 9:05 pm_:
  I tried Avast. Pretty impressive.
