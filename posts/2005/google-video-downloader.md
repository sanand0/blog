  Have you tried www.youtube.com Google will probably take it over!
- **S Anand** _5 Jan 2006 6:00 pm_:
  I use it. But why would Google take over? They already have a pretty good service...
- **Madhu** _6 Jan 2006 12:11 pm_:
  Why not? MSN will take over otherwise.

  s anand, I saw your Swindon vidoes. They are edited very well. What software did you use? Especially the blue first screen.

  Microsoft Movie Maker. It came bundled with Windows XP on my office laptop.
