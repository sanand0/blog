[Haptic technology](http://www.economist.com/science/tq/displayStory.cfm?story_id=3171347) lets you "touch and feel data".

> Surgical-simulation devices are currently the bread and butter of many haptics companies. Recently, haptics have also been finding their way into consumer products. Many video-game controllers, such as force-feedback steering wheels and joysticks, already contain simple haptic devices to enable virtual rally drivers and pilots to feel the bumps of artificial roads or the rumble of machine guns. Mobile phones are next. Just as existing phones can be programmed to play different ring tones depending on the caller, VibeTone allows for different vibrations. Without reaching into your pocket, you will be able to tell whether it is your boss, spouse, or babysitter who is calling.

Companies like [SensAble](http://www.sensable.com/) make products that simulate touch for as low as $2,000, and the prices are falling rapidly.
