  I have had great difficulty in watching videos from Google and this one is no exception. I wonder if I am the only one facing this problem.

  the India head of Google said this a few days ago that video.google.com is not allowed in countries like India, Germany, etc because of some compllicated laws. Guess thats what is causing these problems.

  Wow... this is very interesting. I tried accessing this through a proxy server in Britain and was able to view the video. There may be something in what Amit said....
