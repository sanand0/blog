We had a conference call planned at 8:00am. Reva was to join in from India. We got on to the call, and were done by 8:40am.\
9:10am: SMS. **Waited in conference now off to lunch**\
9:56am: Mail. **You didnt initiate the call!**\
10:03am: Reply. **I guess you dialled in at 9am UK time. We had the call at 8am.**\
3:17pm: Mail. **I dialled at 8 GMT = 13.30 IST ? Correct?**\
3:19pm: Reply. **Ah, no. We're 4.5 hours ahead.**\
3:25pm: Mail. **Great Britain is one hour ahead of GMT during summer!**\
3:53pm: Reply. **Yeah, you're right -- most people don't realise Greenwich isn't always on Greenwich Mean Time :-)**
