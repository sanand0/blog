[Ovid catches his credit card thieves](http://www.livejournal.com/users/publius_ovidius/111672.html).

> This morning, I found out that thousands of dollars of charges had been made on two of my credit cards in the past two days. Now, the identity thieves are sitting in jail. This is how it happened. It involves identity theft, a careless thief, one pissed-off Ovid and lots of luck.
