  I tried streaming music to friends... Cool hack. The only thing is that it is not a broadcast... Can be streamed only to a single person unfortunately... :(

  wow, this is pretty cool. Dhar, next time you are free, let's try this out :-)

  I did, this afternoon. I could hear Dhar's broadcast clearly, but he couldn't hear mine. Problem with my laptop, I think.
