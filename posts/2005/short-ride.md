After a long time, things started going right for a change.\
**7:15pm**: Get out of office.\
**7:22pm**: Walk into train platform **exactly** as the train arrives. The **right** train.\
**7:40pm**: Long walk to change trains at London Bridge. Once again, the train arrives bang on cue.\
**7:47pm**: Another change of platform at Bank. Train to Newbury Park arrives almost immediately.\
**8:15pm**: Out of Newbury Park station.\
That was easily the shortest ride I had from Croydon to Newbury Park. Probably will continue to be the shortest ever.
