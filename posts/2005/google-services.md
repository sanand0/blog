  All I know is that when I typed in the URL my cache came suggested this: http://services.google.com/university/

  Even more interesting. They have something running on port 8882 . While connecting to port 8882 gives a blank page, you get something when you connect to http://services.google.com:8882/urlconsole/controller

  More stuff [1](http://services.google.com/awp/en_us/breeze/6853/main.swf), [2](https://services.google.com/tc/Welcome.html), [3](http://services.google.com/events/askanengineer_rsvp) and more to be found by typing the query "site:services.google.com"
