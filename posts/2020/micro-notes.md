excerpt: I keep notes in hundreds of small Markdown files, synced on Dropbox.
---

I maintain my (extensive) notes in text files. I've explored Evernote, Onenote, Google Keep, Apple Notes, and many other platforms. But text files work. I store them as Markdown and sync them on DropBox.

They used to be relatively large files (50-100KB) each, on broad topics. For example:

- **todo.txt** was a consolidated list of things I had to do
- **people.txt** was a list of everything I knew about people (addresses, birthdays, etc)
- **towrite.txt** was a list of everything I wanted to write about
- **notes.txt** was where I tracked notes about any topics
- ... and more

This led to a couple of problems.

1. **Searching across files was hard**. I wouldn't remember if I wrote ideas for my next talk in todo.txt or towrite.txt, or if my meeting minutes where in notes.txt todo.txt. I had to open each file and search.
2. **Files were getting too big**. Editing them on mobile was harder. Scanning them was harder.

So I changed this system a few years ago into **micro-notes**. These files became a folder. For example, my **notes/** folder looks like this:

- **time-management.txt** has my time management notes
- **book-never-split-the-difference.txt** has book notes on [Never Split the Difference](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26156469-never-split-the-difference)
- **eat-food-sleep-exercise-live-healthy.txt** has notes on fitness

The folder has nearly 300 files. Here's a glimpse of the latest files.

Similarly, my **people/** folder has details of my discussions with various people I interact with -- friends, colleagues & clients.

What made this change possible is [Everything](https://www.voidtools.com/), a fast file search tool on Windows that lets me find files as I type. For example, if I'm looking for my notes on [SlideSense](https://slidesense.ai/), I just type "notes s" and it appears on the list.

I usually sort the files by run count (how often I opened them). That makes it easy to re-open the most used files.

It also makes it easier to edit these notes on mobile. I sync the folder on Dropbox, and use [IAWriter](https://ia.net/writer) to edit them while on walks. [Dictation](https://support.apple.com/en-in/HT208343) is pretty good, so I've been using that to take notes too.

  Welcome back Anand. I have been following your "blog" (hope the term is still relevant!) for more than a decade. Your matter-of-fact writing is something that I enjoy and your experiences using various tools/approaches have always been interesting. Hope we can see more of your writing.
