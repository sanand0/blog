My most-used apps in 2020 were:

1. [Everything](https://www.voidtools.com/). Locates files. Like [Finder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finder_(software)). Fast and brilliant.
2. [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). But [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge) is pretty good, and I'm using it for secondary accounts.
3. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It's my note-taker, TODO list, outliner, **and** IDE.
4. [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/). I'm addicted.
5. [PowerPoint](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/powerpoint). I use it to make & edit videos, not just slides.
6. [Zoom](https://zoom.us/). Thanks to the lockdown. Breakout rooms are great.
7. [Mail](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/mail-and-calendar/9wzdncrfhvqm). It uses under 50MB. Gmail takes 250MB.
8. [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/). It still plays all formats, but I'm looking for a replacement.
9. [Seafile](https://www.seafile.com/en/home/). Our private Dropbox.
10. [AutoHotKey](http://autohotkey.com/). The best macro tool, but hard to use.

The new utilities I started using recently are:

1. [WizTree](https://wiztreefree.com/). Fast visual disk space analyzer.
2. [PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/releases/). [FancyZones](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/fancyzones) and [ColorPicker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/color-picker) are my favorites.
3. [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). Run Linux on Windows, natively (it's fast).
4. [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). Expose local web apps publicly.
5. [TabMemFree](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tabmemfree/pdanbocphccpmidkhloklnlfplehiikb). Closes unused Chrome tabs, saves memory.

The gadgets I bought this year are:

1. [Casio CT-X9000IN keyboard](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B07GJT6XCN/). Good touch response. I play every day.
2. [HP Pavilion x360](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B07NMSWFS4/). My first touchscreen laptop. Yet to explore touch apps.
3. [Raspberry Pi](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B07XSJ64ZY/). But I'm yet to use it 😟
4. [Teqneq S530 Bluetooth earbud](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B08MZWH7XQ/). 2% of an airpod's cost.
5. [JBL Endurance Run Headphones](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B07CFDXLFC/). More durable than [Foxbit FX500](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B07YVLVL94/) / [JBL C100SI](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B01DEWVZ2C/) — but one ear always conks off in a few months.
6. [PureIT Eco](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B08BJN4MP3/). Consumes a lot less water than regular RO purifiers.
7. [Treetop Air Purifier](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B07FPGJ1G1/). Fairly quiet, and shows the air quality.
