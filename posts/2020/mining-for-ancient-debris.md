excerpt: How to mine for Ancient Debris in the Nether using exploding beds
---

I've been active on [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/) for the last 6 months, thanks to my daughter. She keeps watching game videos for hours. I thought I'd see what the big deal was, and made one myself.

In this 5-minute clip, I'm mining for [Ancient Debris](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Ancient_Debris) in the [Nether](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/The_Nether) by placing [beds](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Bed) -- which explode when used in the Nether. That's a quick way to clear large areas and is cheaper than [TNT](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/TNT). Ancient Debris is used to make [Netherite Scrap](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Netherite_Scrap) which makes [Netherite ingots](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Netherite_Ingot) that can upgrade to Netherite weapons and armor -- the strongest things in Minecraft.

Why do I care? Well, when my friend's son said "You're the only adult I know who plays Minecraft", I felt 20 years younger 😊.
