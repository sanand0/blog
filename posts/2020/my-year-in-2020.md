In 2020 I made 3 resolutions.

1. **Read 50 books**. I almost made it. Here are my [reviews](/blog/books-in-2020/).
2. **Walk 10,000 steps** daily. [I managed it](/blog/walking-10000-steps-a-day/), like the last two years.
3. **Lose 2 kgs**. I failed -- and instead, put on 6 kgs.

On **self-improvement**, I completed a [Landmark course](http://ec2-52-26-194-35.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/x/d?c=10417628&l=c842000e-931e-4d54-af9c-ebbc6c54d7bc&r=45175846-d074-47f3-8009-1c30fffcb3b5) and an [Art of Living](https://artofliving.org/) course. Both had a huge productivity impact. (Mail me for details.)

On **software**, I starting playing Minecraft and moved from Gmail to Windows 10 Mail. [More on this](/blog/software-gadgets-2020/).

On **training,** we built a [data storytelling course](https://gramener.com/data-storytelling-workshop) and intend to train 100,000 people. (You can [register](https://gramener.com/data-storytelling-workshop) for a free 90-min online workshop.)

In 2021, I'm taking up 3 new goals.

1. **Lose 10 kgs**. I'll share my stats publicly.
2. **Fail big**. Take up initiatives I'm likely to fail on and learn.
3. **Calendar integrity**. Do what my calendar says, no matter what.

Hope you have an amazing 2021!
