[Word detective](http://www.word-detective.com/backidx.html) traces the origins of strange words. For instance, Yahoo means an ignorant brute. Hamburgers have nothing to do with ham -- they're so called because they come from Hamburg, Germany. Beefeaters are the guards at the The Tower of London (Yeomen guards). Word detective doesn't know why they're called that, but I can confirm first-hand that the Yeomen guards don't know why themselves.
