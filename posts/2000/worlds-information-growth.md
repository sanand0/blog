A [study](http://www.sims.berkeley.edu/how-much-info/) shows that the world is producing about 250MB of info per person per year. It means that, on average, **each of us** is writing 50 times the size of the complete works of Shakespeare **every year**! If you're wondering how that's possible, just wander around this web page :-)
