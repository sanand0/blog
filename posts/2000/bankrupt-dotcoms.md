What's more of a rage than profitable dot-coms? Bankrupt dot-coms, as listed by [dotcomfailures](http://www.dotcomfailures.com), [startupfailures](http://www.startupfailures.com/), and [fuckedcompany](http://www.fuckedcompany.com/). Scepticism's gone far enough to make this [web economy bullshit generator](http://www.dack.com/web/bullshit.html) a great hit.
