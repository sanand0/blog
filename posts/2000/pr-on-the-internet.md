While hunting for some stuff on public relations on the Internet, I found [10 ways public relations specialists can use the Internet](http://saturn.vcu.edu/~jcsouth/library/workshops/pubrelat.html). Actually, the links are useful to anyone doing any news research. [What's Next Online, 12th July](http://whatsnextonline.com/wno/newsletter27.html) has a good writeup on how to research online. I did find some good Internet PR related links too on [About.com](http://publicrelations.about.com/careers/publicrelations/msub9.htm), [Connecting Online](http://www.connectingonline.com/articles/prplan.html) and [Impulse Research](http://www.impulse-research.com/resource.html).
