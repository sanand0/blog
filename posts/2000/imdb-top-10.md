It turns out that I've seen 9 out of the top 10 movies according to the [Internet Movie Database](http://us.imdb.com/top_250_films). As of today, the list read: Godfather, Shawshank Redemption, American Beauty, Schindler's List, Casablanca, Citizen Kane, Star Wars, Godfather: Part II, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Dr. Strangelove (which I haven't seen).
