I received a file called Navidad.exe a few days ago and stupidly ran it. Turned out to be a virus that killed the system. Google produced no answers to searches on "Navidad.exe virus" except [a posting on egroups](http://www.egroups.com/message/rgt/72) -- in Spanish. A translation through [Babelfish](http://babelfish.altavista.com) almost yielded [readable material](http://babelfish.altavista.com/translate.dyn?lp=es_en&doit=done&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.in-contact.com%2Finternet%2Fseguridad%2Findex.php3) and I was able to fix it. [Symantec's AV Center](http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/) has a [cure](http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.navidad.html).
