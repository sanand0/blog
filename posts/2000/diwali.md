It was a rather busy week. Nothing much happened. I realized that I'd been roaming around too much, and that it was time to get to some assignments. Not that much work was done. Understandable, since most of my time was spent reading [movie scripts](http://www.script-o-rama.com) -- notably [The World is Not Enough](http://www.geocities.com/rankostome5/bond19.txt).

Diwali was not at all bad, considering that most of it was spent away from home. After spending 10 hours in front of the computer, I walked home from the Ilford station, when I was greeted with a BANG! It was with pure delight that I turned around, just in time to see a rocket exploding. It took me 45 minutes to walk home that night, watching as I was all the sights in the sky. Never, even in India, have I seen such lovely firework displays. The noise was probably a BIT subdued, but I wouldn't even be sure of that. The place even smelt like home! I did hear the comment that "Indians have to bring noise pollution even here, do they?" Sure. We make ourselves at home. We lit a lamp, and that was about it for Diwali.

There this site called [Fotango](http://www.fotango.com) that develops films for free and posts them online. I sent 4 rolls to them. The deal is that, you put all these rolls in an envelope, and mail it to them (postage is prepaid). After 3-4 days, the develop your film, mail the negatives to you, and put up the snaps online on their site. So how do they make money? Well, if you print out any snaps, they charge you. But they're also in the process of building online communities and all that. Well, sounds good, but my bet is still on Yahoo!
