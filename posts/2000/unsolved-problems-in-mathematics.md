In 1900, David Hilbert outlined [23 unsolved problems in mathematics](http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/hilbert/problems.html). Many of these have been solved today, with the notable [exception of the Riemann Hypothesis](http://www.tbtf.com/blog/2000-08-13.html#9). Today, if we [solve any of these](http://www.claymath.org/prize_problems/), we get $1 million.
