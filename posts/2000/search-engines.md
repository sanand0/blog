[Direct Hit](http://www.directhit.com/) (from AskJeeves) is a search engine. [Copernic](http://www.copernic.com/) is a software that searches multiple sites. [Flyswat](http://www.ragingbull.altavista.com/downloads/flyswat/) is a way of interfacing a messaging board with your browser. I've heard they're all cool.
