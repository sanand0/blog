The [IT Bill](http://www.mit.gov.in/it-bill.htm) has been passed. That means digital signatures are the same as written ones. We're hoping to make money on that! We wrote a first-draft proposal for our [Business Modules in E-Commerce](http://www.iimb.ernet.in/iimb/html/m-frames.jsp?ilink=107&pname=faculty.jsp&areaid=7) course.
