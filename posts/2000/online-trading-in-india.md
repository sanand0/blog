[Geojit securities](http://www.geojit.com/) was the first site where you could trade stocks online. [ICICIDirect](http://www.icicidirect.com/) followed. Now there's a whole bunch (based on a [Khoj search](http://www.khoj.com/bin/khoj_search?searchkey=online+broker)): [Abhipra](http://www.abhipra.com/), [Agroy](http://www.agroy.com/), [Ansec](http://www.anseconline.com/), [iBroking](http://www.ibroking.com/) [India bulls](http://www.indiabulls.com/), [Investment map](http://www.investmentmap.com/) and [Stock mantra](http://www.stockmantra.com/). I'm going to start an account soon.
