[First and second](http://www.firstandsecond.com) looks much cheaper than [Fabmart](http://www.fabmart.com) or [Rediff](http://www.rediff.com). Compare Archer's "To cut a long story short", for example. Rediff: 167. Fabmart: 127. First and second: 105. Or "Built to last". Rediff: not available. Fabmart: 354. First and second: 274. Oh well, I'm going to need a [bot](http://www.botspot.com). Why can't I make one?
