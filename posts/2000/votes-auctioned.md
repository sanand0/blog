A guy called Baumgartner at the RPI set up a site that lets people [auction their votes](http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,38355,00.html). Users of Gnutella (and Napster) are [free-riding](http://www.parc.xerox.com/istl/groups/iea/papers/gnutella/FreeRidingA.html). People are [faking videos real-time](http://www.techreview.com/articles/july00/amato.htm). Author's [reviews are forged](http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/12412.html). Life in the 21st century doesn't look promising ;-)
