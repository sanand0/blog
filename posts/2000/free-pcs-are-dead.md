[Free PCs are dead](http://www.cnn.com/1999/TECH/ptech/12/03/free.pc.salon/). Freebies are dying, since [online advertising is dying](http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1007-200-3357286.html). Now, [Altavista's free ISP died](http://www.usatoday.com/life/cyber/invest/ina405.htm). Is this the beginning of the end for [free ISPs in India](http://www.freeispsearch.com/free_internet_access/india.html)? For that matter, is this the end of free **everything**? No. Free software thrives ([Opera will be free](http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2662009,00.html)). Why is that?
