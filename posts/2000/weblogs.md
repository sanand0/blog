Don't know what a [web log](http://www.weblogs.com/) is? It's a site where people talk -- usually about the Web. Some are discussions. Some are moderated. Some are narratives -- like mine. [Scripting news](http://www.scripting.com/) is my favourite, and [SlashDot](http://www.slashdot.org)'s another popular one. [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com)'s the most popular, I hear.
