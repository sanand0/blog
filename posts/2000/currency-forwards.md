Prof. [Apte](http://www.iimb.ernet.in/faculty/faculty/Pgapte.htm) mentioned that the [currency forward](http://www.travelexusa.com/prod-contracts.htm) is not an [unbiased estimator](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/UnbiasedEstimator.html) of the future spot rate, but is the certainty equivalent of it. The [Kelly FAQ](http://www.bjmath.com/bjmath/kelly/kellyfaq.htm) gives a good description of what certainty equivalence means.
