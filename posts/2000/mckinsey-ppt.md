The McKinsey presentation was this evening at Lord's. Yes, that's the Lord's Cricket Ground. So at 7PM, there was this huge crowd of people strolling over to the Nursery Pavillion, wondering why Lord's had a square cricket pitch. Google and AskJeeves haven't given me an answer yet.

McKinsey's presentation had two high points. First, it was mercifully brief. The entire presentation was for 2 or 3 minutes, and all that this partner said was, "Hey, we love LBS. You know about us. So we're all standing here, here, and here. Come over and talk to us."

So we went over and talked. I mean, I hate networking, especially if I don't have any questions to ask. But still, I've been instructed to collect visiting cards. So may as well. I walked over to a lady called Sacred, who told me what she was doing at the Business Technology office at London. Sounded like fun. Then I met this partner at the Kuala Lumpur office, called Alex Smith. He was wearing a terribly funny looking shirt, and I figured he just couldn't be from McKinsey. But he was. So I asked him how he ended up in Kuala Lumpur? I guess it kindof embarassed him, because he started of with how his significant other was there, and that he moved there, and she moved to Paris, and how it was a long story, and let's not get into it. Fine by me. Anyway, I spent the next half-hour just listening to him. It was a nice experience, and I walked away without bothering with a card.

I haven't mentioned the other high point, though. Chocolates. The people at Lord's handed out these HUGE balls of chocolate that was shaped like a cricket ball. I ate mine in a flash. When I was leaving, I found another on the floor. I mean, this is getting to be a habit. But this time, there were no qualms. The wrapper was on, and I hadn't stepped on it. Sure was a feast that night!
