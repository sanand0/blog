Prove God exists. [Descartes proved it](http://www.orst.edu/instruct/phl302/philosophers/descartes-god.html) by assuming that 'Cogito, ergo sum'. [ProofGodExists.com](http://www.proofgodexists.org/creator.html) uses what's called the Watchmaker Argument -- that there can be no watch without a watchmaker. [Richard Dawkins](http://www.world-of-dawkins.com/) countered that beautifully in [The Blind Watchmaker](http://www.world-of-dawkins.com/blind.htm). Now, I'm a religious guy and all that. But I'd rather take God on faith than proof, OK?

  regardless of my religious convictions Descartes reasoning was flawed when he 'proved' the exsistance of god. flawed for many reasons which only one of was the lack of applying his own method of doubt.
