While we're on metrics, here are some search engine metrics from [useit.com](http://www.useit.com/about/searchreferrals.html), [Media Metrix](http://www.searchenginewatch.com/reports/mediametrix.html), [Nielsen's NetRatings](http://www.searchenginewatch.com/reports/netratings.html) and [StatMarket](http://www.searchenginewatch.com/reports/statmarket.html). Yahoo's right on top, followed by MSN.
