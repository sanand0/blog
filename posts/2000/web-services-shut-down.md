[Finance.com](http://www.finance.com/) has shut down. [Desktop.com](http://www.desktop.com/) too. [NetZero](http://www.freeinternet.com/). And the biggest of all: [Pets.com](http://www.pets.com/) ([chart](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ipet&d=b)). This is more the [trend](http://www.fuckedcompany.com) than exception. People who had accounts on these? Tough luck! That's one reason to stick to big players like Yahoo or Microsoft.
