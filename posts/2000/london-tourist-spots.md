I went to the [Tower of London](http://users.netreach.net/admyers/homepage/images/england/10_Tower_of_London.jpg) on a guided tour with a hilarious [Yeoman Guard](http://search.corbis.com/default.asp?i=11401858&vID=1&rID=101). The [Tower Bridge](http://users.netreach.net/admyers/homepage/images/england/08_Tower_Bridge.jpg), just next to it, is what people usually mistake to be the [London Bridge](http://users.netreach.net/admyers/homepage/images/england/07_London_Bridge.jpg). [Oxford Street](http://users.netreach.net/admyers/homepage/images/england/26_Oxford_Street.jpg) was expensive, but great for window shopping. The [British Musuem](http://search.corbis.com/default.asp?i=10324581&vID=1&rID=101), however, is free, and is a whole universe in itself.
