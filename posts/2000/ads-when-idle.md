[AdReady](http://www.adready.com/a/site/adready/adready.html) has a neat idea: pop up advertisements near the mouse pointer, when the mouse is sitting idle. Cool. But I don't want anything popping up when I'm **reading**! Besides, since this is an easy idea to copy, I doubt they should have it as their USP.
