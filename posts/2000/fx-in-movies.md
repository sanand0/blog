Speed 2: Cruise Control. The climax. A tanker is getting blown up. Why, then, is a [cow flying out as debris](http://vfxhq.com/spotlight97/9711e.html)? If you're interested in special effects, [Visual Effects HQ](http://www.vfxhq.com/) is all about FX in movies. About.com [talks about the technology](http://filmmaking.about.com/movies/filmmaking/msub24.htm). Yahoo!, as usual, has a whole bunch of [deadly FX links](http://dir.yahoo.com/Entertainment/Movies_and_Film/Filmmaking/Special_Effects/).
