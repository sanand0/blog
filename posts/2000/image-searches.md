These days I need to search a lot for images. [images.altavista.com](http://images.altavista.com) and [gallery.yahoo.com](http://gallery.yahoo.com) have proven very handy. To me, it seems Altavista's the eternal innovator, and gives away its lead to Yahoo. They came up with the image service first (and its still better). But their [babelfish](http://babelfish.altavista.com) language translator is still one of its kind.
