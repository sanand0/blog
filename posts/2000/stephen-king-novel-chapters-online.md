Amazon.com moved retailers to the web, and disintermediated retail inventory. SimonSays.com is a publisher (Simon & Schuster) on the Web. [Stephen King](http://www.stephenking.com/)'s an **author** on the Web. You can buy his book from him directly, and online. He's releasing [The Plant](http://www.stephenking.com/plant_FAQ.html) in installments. Each installment will be about a dollar. That's pretty cheap for an online book, but then, he only has server storage and tracking costs and all that. He says he'll stop writing the next part if people don't pay enough. Payment rate is over 75% so far. This is an experiment to watch.
