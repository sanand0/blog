Why do we drive on the left? The medieval nobility wielded their sword on the right (mostly), and rode on the left, so as to chop off oncoming horsemen. Peasants walked on the right to avoid the swords. While the New Scientist's [last word](http://www.newscientist.com/lastword/) reveals why [Napolean drove on the right](http://www.newscientist.com/lastword/answers/lwa1013mysteries.html), it's not clear why Americans do. Kevin Lowey has a [different opinion](http://duke.usask.ca/~lowey/brain/learned_today.html), though.
