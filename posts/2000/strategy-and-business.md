I found some interesting articles on [Strategy & Business](http://www.strategy-business.com/) magazine. How Novell manages their [reseller channel](http://www.strategy-business.com/bestpractice/96206/), how brick-and-mortar companies can [brand on the Internet](http://www.strategy-business.com/bestpractice/99207/) and [corporate culture](http://www.strategy-business.com/culture_change/00103) on the Internet.
