A [paper](http://ecommerce.vanderbilt.edu/papers/pdf/CDNOW.draft.jan001.pdf) at [eLab](http://ecommerce.vanderbilt.edu/papers.html) talks about how [CDNow](http://www.cdnow.com) prices its online advertisements. It argues that [CPM](http://adres.internet.com/primer/article/0,1401,,00.html) is an archaic model, and measuring advertisement **performance** is more important.
