You can [use the Fed Futures](http://www.dismalscientist.com/thoughts/th_mb_012800_tech.stm) to get the market's estimate of whether the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates. My guess, based on the [numbers](http://www.cbot.com/cbot/quotes/fin_futures/0,1860,FF,00.html) is that it will happen in late January 2001. Buy up stocks before then!
