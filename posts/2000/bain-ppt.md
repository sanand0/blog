I had to attend the Bain presentation today at 10AM, so I tried getting to LBS early. I started at 8:45AM. But for some reason, the train crawled on. The engineer couldn't figure out why himself. Anyway, as a result, the train was nearly half-an-hour late. Now, if the Bangalore Mail came in half-an-hour late, I'd be thankful. But here, it's gotten to the point where one makes appointments relying on the efficiency of the British Rail. Well, it's a lesson, I guess.

But the lesson was not without its benefits. While I was sitting in this train, with nothing better to do, I decided to see what people were wearing. I was wearing a suit and a jacket, carrying an umbrella with a book in my hand. I looked at they guy in front. He was wearing a suit and a jacket, carrying an umbrella with a book in his hand. I looked around. The description seemed to fit quite a few of the people on the train. I guess it's their uniform or something.

The Bain presentation was fine. Since I came in late, I couldn't follow much, so I whiled my time looking at the people in the presentation. The hall was packed (over 150 people), and yet I couldn't find a single soul (apart from myself) with a moustache. The reason I was looking was that the guy on the train had a moustache, and it was a fairly rare sight. I figured I may as well prove that he's a statistical anamoly.

Speaking of statistics, I had some time to kill at Baker Street. So I sat down and surveyed the crowd. I noted the racial characteristics of the first 100 people whom I saw. Here's the breakdown:

| Ethnicity | Count   |
| --------- | ------- |
| African   | 8       |
| Chinese   | 9       |
| Indian    | 5       |
| Caucasian | 78      |
| **Total** | **100** |

Certainly can't find this kind of a mix in most cities, I'm fairly sure. London _is_ cosmopolitan.

We spent the afternoon with Pierce Brosnan. Awfully nice chap. He even posed with us for a snap.
