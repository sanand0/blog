<p>I've jumbled up pictures of 10 Bollywood actors. You can move the jumbled blocks around, like a jigsaw. Can you guess the actors?</p>

  are you sure jigsaw 5 is right ? I guess it is A Kh. I entered the wikipedia spelling and it still says it is wrong. Sorry for the partial spoiler.

  @Sathya: Jigsaw 5 is not Aamir Khan, Sathya. He is on the list, though.

  Nice one, and was able to solve it as well within 5 mins :)

  Any idea why the clues don't open up for me? I'd be interested in knowing.
- **sathya** _25 Aug 2008 2:30 am_:
  I dint mean Aamir khan ... but Ak Kh (son of an actor) ... in case u r planning to post the answers, i'll wait.
- **S Anand** _27 Aug 2008 7:13 am_:
  @Sathya: I used his name without the "e" after the first name. That seemed to have more results on a Google search that with. But you're right -- Wikipedia spells his name with the "e".\
  \
  Of course, all of this wouldn't be a problem if I implemented a decent fuzzy search like my other quizzes. Will do that.
- **sathya** _28 Aug 2008 3:26 am_:
  yeah. fuzzy search is a good idea. Another approach could be to use the "did u mean" like functionality that search engines offer. Peter Norvig's approach could be used for this (which you had also linked in one of your posts).\
  \
  I would be curios to know which approach and how, you are going to implement the fuzzy search.

  Hi Anand,\
  \
  I dont know how I stubled upon your blo & since then has become a fan ;)\
  \
  Solved this one in 5 mins.\
  \
  The feed shows multiple posts for same title in bloglines. Is it because of you updating the same post?
- **S Anand** _15 Sep 2008 12:43 am_:
  @Kalpesh: That's right. Every time I make a minor tweak to the post, it's shown again, I'm afraid.
- **smrithy** _1 Dec 2011 1:18 pm_:
