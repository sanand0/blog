It's been three weeks since I [initiated the effort to type in the Dilbert strips](/blog/dilbert-search-engine/) and the results are encouraging. About 2 years worth of strips [have been typed out](http://dilbert-search.appspot.com/). So this [Dilbert viewer](/dilbert.html) now has a reasonably sized index for searching.

Many thanks are in order here. The first is due to [geek.nl](http://www.geek.nl/), whose [images](http://www.geek.nl/pics/dilbert-arch/) I have taken the liberty of hotlinking. Thanks also to those who've taken the time out to type strips:

- granger95
- bthangaraj
- gdibyo
- adrienbernard
- sundar.ramakrishnan
- pistohl
- waywardone
- balamurugan.cse
- sruppenthal

... and several others.

When I initially planned to share the typing of the Dilbert strips, I anticipated that I would probably type in the most, and almost no one would pitch in. While I still have typed in the most, the contributions of the above have been of great help in more than the obvious way. When I typed out 10 years of [Calvin & Hobbes](/calvin/), it took me 5 years. This is 2 years of Dilbert in 3 weeks. If nothing else, it's pushing me to work harder on this. So thanks again for the motivation.

**Here's my request again to all you Dilbert fans.**

1. Please go to [dilbert-search.appspot.com](http://dilbert-search.appspot.com/)
2. Log in using your Google account and type in as many strips as you like
3. Bookmark it for the future, whenever you're bored

Here's a [Wordle](http://wordle.net/) cloud of all the strips typed out so far (with Dilbert and Pointy Haired Boss removed.)

(Seeing that there's more "good" than "bad", and more "like" than "dislike" or "hate", you might even call Dilbert an optimistic strip.)

  You've posted this again? Each time you post this, I do atleast one strip!
- **S Anand** _25 Oct 2008 6:18 am_:
  Hmm... don't know why that happened. I didn't realise it appeared again on\
  Google Reader until yesterday. Maybe I just changed a word or so. Well, all\
  the better :-)\

  How should "Pointy Haired Boss" be capitalized?
- **S Anand** _25 Oct 2008 11:25 am_:
  I'm not sure, Elleana. I use "Pointy haired boss" consistently. I think\
  you've used "Pointy Haired Boss" consistently. Since the search is\
  ultimately case-insensitive, I guess it's OK either way.\
  And thanks for all your effort!\

  Hi,\
  \
  I was reading ur blog posts and found some of them to be very good.. u write well.. Why don't you popularize it more.. ur posts on ur blog took my particular attention as some of them are interesting topics of mine too;\
  \
  BTW I help out some ex-IIMA guys who with another batch mate run www.rambhai.com where you can post links to your most loved blog-posts. Rambhai was the chaiwala at IIMA and it is a site where users can themselves share links to blog posts etc and other can find and vote on them. The best make it to the homepage!\
  \
  This way you can reach out to rambhai readers some of whom could become your ardent fans.. who knows.. :)\
  \
  Cheers,
