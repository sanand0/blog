  Small tip - If you are not a member of Amazon prime, then do check out their free trial..Cancel it just before expiry or better still, remove the tick for auto renew in your account!
- **S Anand** _15 Sep 2008 12:41 am_:
  Is there any benefit other than free next day delivery? I usually end up ordering the free 2-4 day delivery, and end up collecting it from the post office during the weekend! So unless I'm ordering on a Friday or Saturday, next day delivery probably doesn't help me much.
