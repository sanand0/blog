<p>I left my camera near the window of my office at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_wharf">Canary Wharf</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_lapse">time lapse</a> mode on a cloudy day. The video is playing at 60 times normal speed.</p>
<p><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/4JTTOaHi9RU&hl=en&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/4JTTOaHi9RU&hl=en&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object></p>
<p>Check out the related time lapse videos. They're stunning. With <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1T_EkuMwsk">this one</a>, you can figure out which firms work till late in the night.</p>

  Hey Anand,\
  \
  Did you require some additional equipment to take snaps at particular intervals?\
  \
  Cheers,\
  D.
- **S Anand** _27 Nov 2008 6:58 am_:
  Nope -- my Canon IXUS 70 has a time-lapse mode. I just placed the camera on\
  the floor and let it do it's job for an hour :-)

  Really nice Anand... Fantastic to know that this can be done by a normal user too...
