I've added some interactivity to the [Statistically improbable phrases](http://sip.s-anand.net/) application. You can now:

- Filter out stopwords
- Dynamically filter infrequent words and commonly used words
- Dynamically play with the contrast and font size

  I love this application. Because now, I can create a url to NY Times, and see what is the main subject of the day. :)

  I was curious as to whether or not I could use this pointed into a specific personal corpus to separate documents from one another.
