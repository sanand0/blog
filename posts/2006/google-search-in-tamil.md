<p>When I wrote my <a href="/blog/tamil-song-lyrics-quiz-2000s/">Tamil song lyrics quizzes</a>, I had two problems:</p><ol>
<li>I can't write in Tamil (not on paper, nor on a computer)</li>
<li><b>I can't spell right in Tamil</b> (&#2984; vs &#2985;, &#2992; vs &#2993;)</li>
</ol>
<p>I overcame the first using a <a href="/blog/tamil-transliterator/">Tamil transliterator</a>. I write in English, and you see it in Tamil.</p>
<p>The problem of &#2984; vs &#2985; was simple. &#2984; occurs as the first letter of a word, and just before &#2980;. Nowhere else. (Is this always true?)</p>
<p>But &#2992; vs &#2993; can't be solved except through experience, and I'm short of that. So, rather than bother my family with every quiz, I used the wisdom of crowds. I googled both spellings of the word. <b>The correct spelling has more Google hits than the incorrect one</b>.</p>
<p>I did this so often, I made a Google gadget out of it.</p>
<script src="http://gmodules.com/ig/ifr?url=http://www.s-anand.net/a/tamilsearchgadget.xml&synd=open&w=320&h=400&title=Tamil+Google+Search&border=http%3A%2F%2Fgmodules.com%2Fig%2Fimages%2F&output=js"></script>
<p>Just <b>type the word in English, click 'Search', and my gadget will search in tamil</b>. It's amazing how much stuff there is in Tamil on the Web, from song lyrics to texts (thirukkuraL, for example).</p>
<p>You can add this gadget to:</p><ul>
<li>your desktop (in the Search Gadgets box, type "http://www.s-anand.net/a/tamilsearchgadget.xml")</li>
<li>your website or blog (<a href="http://gmodules.com/ig/creator?synd=open&url=http://www.s-anand.net/a/tamilsearchgadget.xml">click here for the code</a>)</li>
<li>Google Reader. <a href="http://fusion.google.com/add?feedurl=http%3A//www.s-anand.net/a/tamilsearchgadget.xml"><img src="http://buttons.googlesyndication.com/fusion/add.gif" width="104" height="17" border="0" alt="Add to Google"></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Here's the transliteration table:</p>

  Hi, guess something's wrong with your RSS feeds.. they don't seem to reflect your latest posts
- **S Anand** _7 Oct 2006 6:20 pm_:
  Vasant, I subscribe to my own RSS feeds. They seem fine. Are you subscribing to http://feeds.feedburner.com/sanand? Which RSS reader are you using? And what's the latest post you see?
- **Vasant** _8 Oct 2006 4:43 am_:
  I was subscribing to http://www.geocities.com/root\_node/sanand.xml. Works fine with the other URL. Will change - Thanks
- **Madhu** _9 Oct 2006 11:40 am_:
  Not able to download the gadget though. not available in google gadgets as well. would you have a link? Hope google scans ur page and reports that youtube was my idea and look at my email and automatically send me an offer;)
- **S Anand** _9 Oct 2006 12:02 pm_:
  That's funny, the links in the post work for me... [This link](http://gmodules.com/ig/creator?synd=open&url=http://www.s-anand.net/a/tamilsearchgadget.xml) should add it to your Google home page. Don't think you can "download" it, though. You can at best add it to Google Desktop.
- **Madhu** _12 Oct 2006 8:18 am_:
  Ok. Am able to download it as a gadget though. It says add to webpage.
- **Madhu** _17 Oct 2006 11:01 am_:
  This is an interesting website - www.blinkx.com, unlike youtube and google video you can search for a variety of video sources here. Might be bought out by one of the GYM companies soon!
- **Kesavan.M** _30 Oct 2006 10:05 am_:

  Check out http://kandupidi.com/editor . It supports both google tranliteration as well as english phonetic typing as well which many people prefer. There is a gadget for this as well.
