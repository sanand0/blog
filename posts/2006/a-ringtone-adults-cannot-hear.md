Teenagers use it in classes, to avoid detection by teachers. Shopkeepers use the same technology to drive away rowdy teenagers, by creating a loud sound that doesn't affect adults.

This works because adults gradually lose the ability to hear high-pitched sounds. (via [NY Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/12/technology/12ring.html))
