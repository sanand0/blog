[Funny ads in London](http://www.gumtree.com/london/1286_1.html).

> **[To My Mugger](http://www.gumtree.com/london/58/4818358.html)**:
>
> Last night you stole my phone on Holloway Road, you also stole my heart.
>
> I was the tall brunette in dungarees and psychedelic t-shirt, you were the hooded man on the bike. I was captivated by your white teeth and hypnotic eyes.
>
> My home number is stored on my contacts under "me". (Please don't call me at "me work", or my boyfriend, "Josh".)
>
> I await your call or reply x

> **[Teri Hatcher anyone?](http://www.gumtree.com/london/98/4807998.html)**
>
> Hi thought I'd give this a shot. You never know! I'm desperately seeking the most gorgeous of all Desperate Housewives (sorry Eva, Marcia and Felicity) - Teri Hatcher. I don't know Teri Hatcher nor am I a Norman Bates psycho (maybe on Sundays...is today Sunday?) but hey come on, Teri's great. Or Ms Hatcher as I should call her right?
>
> So if anyone out there knows her or has a connection with her (a REAL connection not those psychic ones. I have one with Tom Jones - doesn't work that way) by all means - help me out! I'll be a good date! I'm cute, funny, and intelligent (I'm actually hideous, blonde brained (sorry all blondes - no offense) and ....yeah intelligent. I'm a nerd!). But not ego centric, Hey wait - if I talk about myself - is that ego centric? Hmm...
>
> So remember ladies and gents - think me, think Teri Hatcher....great now THAT sounds Norman Bates stalker like.... Yikes!

> **[Did I sleep on your sofa?](http://www.gumtree.com/london/25/4706125.html)**
>
> After a very big night out on Saturday, i found myself waking up on someone's sofa on Sunday morning. I didn't hang around to find out who was so kind to take me in.
>
> If it was you, please let me know.
>
> Would like to know how I got there?
