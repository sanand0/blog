<p>Don't worry about the spelling. Just spell it like it sounds, and the box will turn green.</p>

  Pretty good quiz. I scored 5/10 and I think I recognised a few other tunes but couldn't guess the movie. I couldn't even cheat from the page source code, couldn't be bothered to go into JS scripts to get the answers. Thanks. Nice one !! Good website too.
- **S Anand** _9 Oct 2006 12:04 pm_:
  Thanks! (I did go to some pains to encrypt the answers, so the JS scripts wouldn't have helped either :-)
