If you've forgotten your Windows password, but you're still logged in as an administrator, you can [change your Windows password without confirmation of the old password](http://www.lifehacker.com/software/passwords/quickly-change-your-windows-password-even-if-youve-lost-your-old-one-179364.php).

If you're forgotten your Windows password, and **not** logged in, you can still access your system using a little known hole in Windows XP. Check Vic Ferri's article on [I Forgot My Administrator Password](http://pubs.logicalexpressions.com/Pub0009/LPMArticle.asp?ID=305).

  Forgot Your Windows Password?
  A lot of people think that after having lost their Windows admin password, they absolutely have to reinstall their OS. Let me tell you something: They are wrong! Here I'm posting a few methods / utilities which can be used to recover Windows password:
  1st Method:
  The first thing which you check if you forget login password. When we install Windows, it automatically creates an account "Administrator" and sets its password to blank. So if you have forget your user account password then try this:
  Start system and when you see Windows Welcome screen / Login screen, press + and Del keys twice and it'll show Classic Login box. Now type "Administrator" (without quotes) in Username and leave Password field blank. Now press Enter and you should be able to log in Windows.
  Now you can reset your account password from "Control Panel -> User Accounts".
  Same thing can be done using Safe Mode. In Safe Mode Windows will show this in-built Administrator account in Login screen.
  2th Method:
  There are many 3rd party utilities which claim to recover forgotten Windows password:
