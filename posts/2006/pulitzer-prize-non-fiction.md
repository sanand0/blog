These are the Pulitzer prize winning non-fiction books. I've read only two: Godel, Escher, Bach and Guns, Germs and Steel. These were the very best books I have EVER read. If that's any indication to go by, I want to finish this whole list.

  Thanks a ton for the list. Pulitzer books in non-fiction are just gems!
- **Arun** _31 Mar 2006 8:08 am_:
  Ouch, haven't read even one of these. And i thought i read more non-fiction than most!!!
- **S Anand** _31 Mar 2006 9:45 am_:
  Next on my reading list are Ants (don't be fooled: though it's really about ants, it's apparantly a fascinating read), Annals of the Former World (which I developed a liking for since I read A Short History of Everything), and Carl Sagan's Dragons of Eden.
- **Sanchaari** _31 Mar 2006 2:14 pm_:
  Hi Anand, I liked your Bolg style, can I take some ideas from here? Which blogging site you are using?
- **S Anand** _31 Mar 2006 4:47 pm_:
  Feel free to pull ideas. But I don't use any blogging software. I write entries in Excel, and my Perl program converts that to HTML, which I then I FTP. Not much help, I'm afraid...
