[Marriages in Britain are lasting longer](http://www.economist.com/printedition/displayStory.cfm?story_id=6746806). But part of the reason is that there are fewer marriages. More people just live together. The ones that **do** marry are older (30 years, as against 26 years a decade ago) and probably more religious.
