Google has released [Picasa Web Albums](http://picasaweb.google.com/) and I managed to sign up. See [my web albums](http://picasaweb.google.com/root.node).

The bad part about Picasa Web is that it's a long way from [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/) in terms of tagging and sharing. But it probably wasn't built for that.

The good part is that it's integrated with [Picasa](http://picasa.google.com/) (integration with Flickr was my top wishlist item for Picasa) and best of all, with [Google Earth](http://earth.google.com/). You can geotag photos on the new Beta version of Picasa.

  Two quick questions: \
  1. Can I view the orginal size of the image or will I be restricted to some lower resolution image? \
  2. Are there any upload limits (per image or per month)?\
     Cheers, D.

  Oh OK. Question answered:\
  "High-quality photos, automatically resized and optimized to fill available screen space"\
  "Each Picasa Web Albums account comes with 250MB of free storage space"\
  Details [here](http://picasa.google.com/web/help.html).
