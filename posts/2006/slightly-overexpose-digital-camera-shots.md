Based on advice from Thomas Knoll, Michael suggests [overexposing digital camera shots](http://www.luminous-landscape.com/tutorials/expose-right.shtml). This is because the on the CCD of digital cameras, the bright tones have the highest colour resolution. So you can darken images later and retain the colours well, but you can't brighten without losing data.
