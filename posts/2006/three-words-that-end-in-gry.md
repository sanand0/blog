  None it's a riddle and you didn't phrase it right. But this is how it goes:\
  \
  There are three words in The English language that end in "gry". ONE is angry and the other is hungry. EveryONE knows what the third ONE means and what it stands for.. EveryONE uses them everyday, and if you listened very carefully, I've given you the third word.\
  \
  Look carefully at the first sentence and at the part 'The english Language' There are three words in that phrase, the english language the third is the word language.\
  \
  So language is your answer. The rest is a big trick to get you away from the obvious first sentence which holds the answer.
