<p>These are stills from Kamal's movies. Each link points to a different movie. I have jumbled the images. You can <b>move the jumbled blocks around, like a jigsaw</b>. Can you guess the movie?</p>

  its not changing colour ;-(
- **S Anand** _15 Sep 2006 8:22 am_:
  Well, Sathya, then the answer must be wrong ;-) Nah, unlikely. There must be a spelling variation I had not anticipated. Why don't you mail me the answer, and I'll fix it. Thanks!
- **Sathya** _15 Sep 2006 9:28 am_:
  movie 5 has a zigsaw tht does not belong to the movie.
- **S Anand** _15 Sep 2006 11:18 am_:
  You're right. Sorry! Fixed it now.

- **Ashwin** _16 Sep 2006 1:21 pm_:
  Vettayadu Vilayadu is an excellent movie and its doing well in theatres also. Sillunu oru kadhal is not that much good.. Emtan magan is also worth watching, mostly the comedy is good. That's all about current movie status in Tamil nadu.
- **Ashwin** _16 Sep 2006 1:25 pm_:

  I can see that I'm taking this quiz three years after it was posted - came to know of this website very recently. Awesome! This must be one of the easiest quizzes :-) Or probably the only one! 5/5.
- **Ramki** _24 Sep 2009 10:39 pm_:
  Hi Anand,
