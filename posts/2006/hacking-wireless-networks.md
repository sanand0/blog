  Anand, can you recommend a few good podcasts you listen to?
- **S Anand** _20 Jan 2006 12:01 pm_:
  I don't listen to podcasts, I'm afraid! Trains are too noisy, don't like using headphones at office, and prefer watching movies at home. So effectively no place for podcasts :-)
- **Arun** _20 Jan 2006 3:09 pm_:
  Oh..ok..Somehow I thought you had made some post about listening to podcasts on trains sometime ago. Guess it must have been some other blog. Or I must have been dreaming :-)
- **S Anand** _20 Jan 2006 6:32 pm_:
  No, you're right. That was in July, when I was commuting OVER the ground, where there's less noise. Now I commute UNDERground, and can't hear anything, so I'd given up soon after I started.
