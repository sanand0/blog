Philipp Lenssen analysis different kinds of events in the post [Different types of Google trends](http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2006-07-02-n43.html). He graphs (using [Google Trends](http://www.google.com/trends)) the search popularity of different types of keywords over time, and observes how known events have a steady rise and sharp drop (e.g. Christmas) while unknown events have a sharp rise and steady drop (e.g. tsunami). And so forth.
