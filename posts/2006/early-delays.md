I haven't been blogging the last 6-7 weeks. This is partly because I've been averaging 1 book or movie per day, but mostly because I ran out of things to say. I will start again soon. In the meantime, this is an announcement I heard when travelling on the Jubilee line. (The train had halted at North Greenwich.)

> "Ladies and gentlemen, we're being held at this station for a while. This is because, you're not going to believe this, but we're slightly early! We're not due at North Greenwich for another 60 seconds. Once again, I apologise for the delay, which is because we're early.
