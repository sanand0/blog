<p>I've jumbled up some stills from movies. You can <b>move the jumbled blocks around, like a jigsaw</b>. Can you guess the movie?</p>

  Hi Ravi, where are you these days?

  the images keep loading and changing even when they've fully loaded. I think its a bug. Can you fix it? Otherwise the puzzle is brilliant!

  Thanks! This may not be a bug, though. each jigsaw has 3 images from the same movie. Even after loading fully, the jigsaw will loop through images.
