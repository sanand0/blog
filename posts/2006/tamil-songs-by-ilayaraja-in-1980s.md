<p>More songs by Ilayaraja, composed in the 1980s. Can you guess which <b>movie</b> they are from? (Films are NOT repeated)</p>

<p>Don't worry about the spelling. Just spell it like it sounds, and the box will turn green.</p>

  Most of these bits have the movie name in the file info when played in Windows Media player!
- **S Anand** _22 Jul 2006 9:23 am_:
  You're right. I've fixed that now.
- **capriciously_me** _26 Jul 2006 9:54 pm_:
  awesome fun :) 1, 13 and 26 please?
- **S Anand** _27 Jul 2006 4:55 pm_:
  1 is a film starring Prabhu, 2: Kamal and 3: Suresh
- **Anonymous** _28 Jul 2006 12:34 pm_:
  the clue u ve gvn s wrong.2nd s a movie starring karthik and 3rd s the one wth ramarajan
- **S Anand** _28 Jul 2006 8:34 pm_:
  Sorry, I meant 1, 13 and 26 respectively.
- **Sathya** _31 Jul 2006 12:28 pm_:
  thalaiva ... thats just great collection. BTW, if you have the BGMs alone, could you put them as well ?
- **Sathish** _1 Aug 2006 12:53 am_:
  The Quiz was great..I saw ur site today..I have completed 28..if you could give another 5 more seconds of music for the songs 10 & 11, i would appreciate
- **S Anand** _1 Aug 2006 10:15 pm_:
  Sathish, 10 and 11 are both Kamal movies. Does that help?
- **Sathya** _2 Aug 2006 10:52 am_:
  Have you written the common.js yourself ? thats great. I would like to re-use/flick the "maptamil" function. You are quite wicked that you use one way SHA1 hash ... there is no way to hack the answer (is there a way ?). So pls do post the answers ;-(
- **S Anand** _2 Aug 2006 5:02 pm_:
  Yeah, wrote mapTamil myself. Took me 2 weeks of testing on raaga.com -- feel free to reuse!
- **S Anand** _2 Aug 2006 5:05 pm_:
  The reason I picked SHA1 instead of MD5 was that it's tougher to crack. It can be done, but in about [2 power 69 calculations](http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/02/cryptanalysis_o.html)
- **Sathish** _6 Aug 2006 11:39 pm_:

  Maesto is great and cannot express about him in words. His music is a soothing effect / remedy for day to day life complexes. Not like to stop even after repeated listenings. Some addicting magic in his songs and not seen in other musicians. So we like his musics done in 70's, 80's & 90's etc. Thanks to God for getting chance to enjoy his musics.

  Good Collection
- **reghuram** _23 Mar 2012 4:59 am_:
  Raja sir is Nature's grand living sound instrument. The sequence of notes that hit one's heart comes so effortlessly to this maestro that one remains possessed for the entire time listenng to his music. I am particularly awe-struck at all the intro bgms of Raja sir. They have a unique pattern which no other can imitate nor fathom. to cite an example just listen to the intro of the Nalinakanthi piece "enthan nenjil nee thane". Raja sir has that uncanny knack of picking up the key notes of a raga which will not be revealed until the actual pallavi is heard. In fact his into bgms are itself a great rpertoire for research on chors and carnatic music.

  Ilayaraja Sir is like a guru to me. With his songs only I get interested into music. I am thankful to God to hear his music especially rerecoding and orchaestration. Thanks to share with everyone.

- **venkatrajan** _2 Mar 2012 6:14 pm_:
  illayaraja the grammar of music.he is the heart pain reliever by his music
- **Ganesh from N'Castle** _29 Feb 2012 6:52 pm_:
  30/30, grown up with Illayaraja music. Part of life. For every song there has been special and unforgettable occasions and moments. Those days we our friends are very much eager to hear new songs, For us cassettes are expensive, In our town (Pudukkottai) one Tea shop who owned by Sathya ( He resembles Sathya Kamal having beard and styled like Kamal, so we call him Sathya) bought new releases we all our friends top up there hear music with 'Dhum' and Tea for more than an hour. 80 's are the years which never come back again with full of joy and carefree attitude... Nothing But Raja's Muzik...

  Hi! Eswar, I was also looking for the same song for years and finally go it. It is from the movie "Vazhkai". You can download video at You tube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qveg840rPDY.
  The song starts with "mella mella ennai thottu"
- **Prabhakar** _8 Oct 2019 4:12 pm_:
  @Eswar, 24-- I think the movie you are referring to is valzkai and the song is mella mella enai thotu
