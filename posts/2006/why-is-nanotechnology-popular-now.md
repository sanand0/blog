  from all countries in the list indians are the only one with something technical in their queries. hurrah for that
- **Prabhu** _17 Apr 2006 6:03 am_:
  Could be due to the fact that Sujatha is writing an article about it in a tamil weekly
- **S Anand** _17 Apr 2006 7:37 am_:
  If so, Tamil Nadu would have to be a big chunk of India's Google searches. Given the absense of other Tamil queries, I doubt this was the only factor... but it sure must have contributed!
