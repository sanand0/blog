[See how fast you can type](http://labs.jphantom.com/wpm/). I averaged 100 words per minute.

  WOW. @ 100 WPM even if each word had only 3 letters you typed 300 keystrokes in 60 secs not counting spaces. Which is about 5 keystrokes per sec. WOW.

  I'm not the fastest typist I know. When I was at LBS, almost everyone around me typed (what seemed like) two keys for every one of mine.

  amazing. I have trouble hitting the keyboard 5 times while saying 1001,1002. Thats like hummingbird speed. I can manage 100 CPM and about 50 WPM.

  Practice, practice, practice :-)
