Netflix has released a sample of its customers' movie ratings at [Netflix Prize](http://www.netflixprize.com/). You can download these (700 MB), create an algorithm that rates the training data, run it against the test data, and see if you can get better ratings than their algorithm. If you do, you win $1 million. (Chris Anderson [explains why](http://www.longtail.com/the_long_tail/2006/10/why_better_dvd_.html).)
