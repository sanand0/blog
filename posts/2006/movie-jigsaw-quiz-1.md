<p>These are stills from a recent movie. I've jumbled them up. You can <b>move the jumbled blocks around, like a jigsaw</b>.</p>

  Got the name of the movie. But to really crack the jigsaw is difficult because the image keeps changing...
- **Dhar** _24 May 2006 3:17 pm_:
  Damn, is there one small block missing?
- **Dhar** _24 May 2006 3:22 pm_:
  Got it finally!!

  How many blocks did you have to move before you guessed the movie?
- **Arun** _25 May 2006 6:31 am_:
  Wow, totally totally awesome. Took a while, but cracked it. Knowing the movie sure helped though!
- **sangi** _31 May 2006 12:18 pm_:
  did not move any blocks. cracked it immediately. Cool stuff.

  Did you blur Neo's mouth to make the puzzle harder? Or is something else going on?
