  hey good quiz, i got 31: "seen me everyday for 16 years" should read "seen me everyday for 13 years".
- **S Anand** _21 Jan 2006 11:02 am_:
  Correction: "seen me everyday for 16 years" should read "seen me everyday for 13 years".
- **Another corrigendum** _21 Jan 2006 12:55 pm_:
  there's a 'the' mismatch in one of the answers
- **S Anand** _21 Jan 2006 1:14 pm_:

- **Parshu** _2 Feb 2006 6:37 am_:
  how did you create this thng, when i type a name if right it becomes green and score gets updated. Kindly help me out with this technique. So i can too develop something on similar lines
- **S Anand** _2 Feb 2006 5:33 pm_:
  The logic for turning stuff green is the onKeyUp function in those boxes. If what's typed matches the encrypted answer, I turn the style.background attribute to green, and increment the quizCount element (which is just a span element) by 1. Hope it doesn't sound Greek... just see the source.

  Good one anand. I got 34. I think i got the other 6 also but somehow not getting the names in the right format. These movies are sequels & have long names with colon etc.
