Using the [Google Browser Sync](http://www.google.com/tools/firefox/browsersync/index.html) extension for Firefox, you can access your bookmarks, tabs, history, saved passwords and cookies from any machine. You can browse from office, go back home, and continue browsing where you left off. Gina Trapani of Lifehacker says [Google Browser Sync is not a privacy risk](http://www.lifehacker.com/software/google/google-sync-update-not-all-that-evil-179318.php) after all.
