1.5 million internal e-mails of Enron were released after it collapsed, to help figure out why. The [UC Berkeley Enron Email Analysis Project](http://bailando.sims.berkeley.edu/enron_email.html) has some links analysing these emails. Check out the [visual analysis](http://jheer.org/enron/).

  Hi Anand, Did you mean Enron instead of Amazon here? Take Care
- **S Anand** _9 Oct 2006 3:15 pm_:
  Gosh, yes -- sorry, typo on my side. (Wonder why that happened... must've been sleep-typing :-)

  Along the same network visualization lines, http://www.touchgraph.com/TGGoogleBrowser.html and http://liveplasma.com/ are pretty interesting too. Or if you like Digg, http://labs.digg.com/swarm/ works too. (drop me a line some time Anand - kumar (pulli) venkateswar (at) gmail (pulli) com)

  Long time since you've posted any article on your site.. Anand, just a suggestion though.. I think you should start writing more about yourself and the latest in your life.. I am sure there are a lot of takers for that like me. Cheers!
