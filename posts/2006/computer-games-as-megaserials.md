[Are video games going the TV show route](http://www.wired.com/news/columns/0,71181-0.html?tw=wn_columns_games_1)? Will we have game mega serials? Is this the next wave?

Personally it would be a welcome relief. I don't often have the time to complete a full session of Age of Kings these days. Chunks of half-hour scenarios would be great.
