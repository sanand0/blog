I stopped using [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) when I redesigned my site. I track my own statistics. This gives me access to raw data, and I can do my own analyses.

I wanted to know the keywords on Google that led to my site. (Google Analytics only gives you phrases.) I also wanted **independent** words. If you search for "Calvin and Hobbes", I want to count only "Calvin", knowing that it's in the context of "Hobbes".

So I did this analysis. Here are the keywords that lead to my site. (This is based on 3 weeks of data).

1. **excel** in the context of cell, formula, function, leading to my [Excel tips](/excel_tips.html). People mostly want to know how to remove errors like #N/A.
2. **calvin** in the context of hobbes, fight, club. (There was a great article on how [Fight Club is really Calvin and Hobbes](/Fight_Club_is_really_Calvin_and_Hobbes.html).) Most of these queries are searches for specific quotes, and I've typed out all the [Calvin and Hobbes quotes](/calvin/).
3. **indian** in the context of torrents, tv. One of my most popular posts is [Indian Torrents](/Indian_Torrents.html). I simply linked to a couple of Google searches, so it's popularity is unjustified.
4. **tamil** in the context of songs, lyrics, movie. This is mostly thanks to the recent tamil [quizzes](/quizzes.html) I've put up.
5. **mumbai** in the context of local, schedule, train. A shockingly large number of people search for [Mumbai bus and train schedule](/Mumbai_bus_and_train_schedule.html), landing on my link to the IIT-B Mumbai Navigator.
6. **anand** in the context of s anand, bcg, infosys. This is people searching for me.
7. **irr** in the calculating, excel, formula. [Calculating IRR](/Calculating_IRR.html) turned out to be another unexpectedly popular post.
8. **interview** in the context of lehman brothers, bcg, landing at some of my [interview experiences](/interviews.html).
9. **mckinsey** in the context of ppt, presentation. Most of these people are looking for presentations, while I have a link to the [McKinsey pre-placement talk at LBS](/McKinsey_PPT.html). Interesting that BCG is not on the top 10.
10. **google** in the context of engedu, types, authors@google. Though I have several posts about Google, the ones about Google video like [Meet the author](/Meet_the_Author.html) and on [Google TechTalks](/Informative_Google_videos.html) are the most popular.

Having read the actual queries, I've concluded that only the keywords **excel**, **mumbai**, **anand**, **irr** and **interview** definitely lead to relevant hits. The rest are debatable. Maybe I should reduce the importance of the less relevant posts on my [sitemaps](http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=40318) file.
