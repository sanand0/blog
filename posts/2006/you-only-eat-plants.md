**UTSUNOMIYA, Japan, Dec 1998**. I was on a project with Honda R&D at [Utsunomiya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utsunomiya%2C_Tochigi), Japan.

And I'm vegetarian.

The next day, Yoshioka-san -- our counterpart at Honda -- took us to the canteen and introduced me to the chef. Knowing that "vegetarian" in Japan includes eating fish and birds, I took the chef aside.

"I'm vegetarian," I emphasised.

"Hai. Vegetarian."

"I don't eat fish."

"Ah, so. No fish."

"I don't eat chicken. No birds."

"Ah, so. No chicken."

Pause. He looked puzzled. Just to be sure, I added, "I'm vegetarian."

He thought for a long while, and then said,

"So, you eat only plants?"

P.S. I was finally served rice with brocolli. I ate it with pepper.

  I had a similar experience in China and was offered lettuce leaves in vinegar.. I then remembered scolding my mom 2 months back on how the vathha kuzhambu was not up to the mark.
