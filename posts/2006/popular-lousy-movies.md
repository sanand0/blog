If you plot all movies by their number-of-votes on IMDb and their rating on IMDb, you get the chart below. Movies with more votes usually have a higher rating.

I was interested two things:

1. Which are the unpopular, but good (highly-rated), movies?
2. Which are the popular, but lousy, movies?

The answer to the first question is: there are no unpopular good movies. The cluster of dots on the top-left (in red) are not movies -- they're TV shows (Band of Brothers, Pride and Prejudice, Arrested Development).

The answer to the second is: there are 9 really popular lousy movies.

- [Titanic](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120338/)
- [Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120338/)
- [Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120338/)
- [Independence Day](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116629/)
- [Armageddon](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120591/)
- [Pearl Harbor](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0213149/)
- [Batman & Robin](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118688/)
- [Godzilla](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120685/)
- [Wild Wild West](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120891/)

It's interesting that every single one of these had a huge budget. (Perhaps this is understandable: more people would see a big-budget film and vote on it.)
