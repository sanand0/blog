**Decisions are usually based on multiple criteria**. You have to trade off between criteria. I've been involved many such decisions over the last 5 years.

**Example 1**: A conglomerate wanted to **identify industries for growth**. We shortlisted 19 industries, identified 12 criteria for the attractiveness of an industry, researched each one and plotted them on spidergraphs like below.

[![Spidergraph for Industry 1](/blog/assets/flickr-spidergraph-for-industry-1_220831919_o-png.webp)](/blog/assets/flickr-spidergraph-for-industry-1_220831919_o-png.webp) [![Spidergraph for Industry 2](/blog/assets/flickr-spidergraph-for-industry-2_220831920_o-png.webp)](/blog/assets/flickr-spidergraph-for-industry-2_220831920_o-png.webp)

The intention was that, to identify the most favourable industries, you'd just pick the ones with the largest filled area.

**Example 2**: Another time, we had to **decide among BPO vendors**. Again, we picked a bunch of criteria and compared vendors against these criteria.

**Example 3**: Once, we had to **identify stakeholders' position on a project**.

[![Change readiness profile for Dave](/blog/assets/flickr-change-readiness-profile-for-dave_137737506_o-gif.webp)](/blog/assets/flickr-change-readiness-profile-for-dave_137737506_o-gif.webp) [![Change readiness profile for Uli](/blog/assets/flickr-change-readiness-profile-for-uli_137737353_o-gif.webp)](/blog/assets/flickr-change-readiness-profile-for-uli_137737353_o-gif.webp)

Those who were big on the right of the graph were for, and those who were big on the left were against.

In all the above cases, **the same process was used for decision making**.

1. List criteria exhaustively
2. Evaluate options against each criteria
3. Assign weights to criteria (equal weights implicitly assigned above)
4. Compare options

Having applied this methodology it several times, I am convinced this process is **fundamentally flawed**. See how in this post: [Errors in multicriteria decision making](/Errors_in_multicriteria_decision_making.html).

  I am curious to know what the flaw is. To me it seems a pretty well-set method to demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of any case, very visually and clearly.
