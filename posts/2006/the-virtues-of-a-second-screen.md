[The virtues of a second screen](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/20/technology/20basics.html).

> So now, while I am editing this article on my main screen, the screen beside it shows the outline or earlier draft I am working from -- and, sometimes, Web sites or other documents I keep referring to.
>
> When I edit photos, the second screen lets me compare the copy I am working on with the original, or shows tool palettes and thumbnails of other images, and I can blow up panoramic shots for closer viewing (though with a bar down the middle, like the central pillar of an old car's windshield).
>
> When I am shopping on the Web, my two screens let me compare products.
>
> When I work on tables or spreadsheets, I can see all the columns at once. When I expect important messages, I keep my e-mail program open on the side monitor while I work on something else.

  With so much dependency on IT in our day-to-day work, as the author points out even 2 screens wouldn't be sufficient. True. â€˜Ease of useâ€™ has become a major issue in IT systems. That reminds me. Did u check the 'Reveal' and 'Firefox Showcase' plug-ins for Firefox?

  Does anyone use Maxthon also?

  First time I'd heard of it, actually.

  Yeah, but it's a free registration. www.BugMeNot.com might be able to provide you with a username and password.
