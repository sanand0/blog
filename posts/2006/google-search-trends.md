  If you realise shareholders of google can just keep clicking away on the links in their mail or search results. Google makes money but shareholders have no cost. If I were an analyst firm covering google, I would employ people just to keep clicking on the ads;) I guess in a proper market, the per click fee would come down over a long term.
