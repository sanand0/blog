[Determine a sex by name](http://www.lifehacker.com/software/google-school/google-school-determine-a-sex-by-name-167650.php). If you don't know if a name is male or female, just search for the name on Google images. (e.g. "[Priti](http://images.google.com/images?q=Priti)")

  That is not always true. Try 'Kiran'
