  Thats hogwash Anand. Just my opinion.

  Seems more like a crib article more than one which gives answers...

  I wonder, though: isn't it true that ad agencies, in general, **don't** advertise? Why is that?
- **Sai** _15 May 2006 11:16 pm_:
  Don't you think the reason they do not advertise in mainstream media like newspapers & tv is that it is catered to the b2c crowd. But i have always thought that Ad firms do advertise in magazines and such read by decision makers, thought that was the case.

  Quite possible. Even so, it looks like they advertise less than other industries. And that is odd...
