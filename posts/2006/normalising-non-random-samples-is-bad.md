title: Normalising non-random samples is bad

<p>I rate movies on a scale of 1 (bad) to 5 (good). This is an absolute scale. Initially, I assumed that I would watch as many good movies as bad ones. So I'd have about as many 1s as 5s, and 2s as 4s. But, when I looked at my ratings for movies over the last year, I had far more 4s than 2s. <b>My movie ratings were not normal</b>.</p>
<table class="numbers">
<tr><th>Rating</th><th>Frequency</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>8</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>31</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>98</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>81</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>18</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The reason is clear. <b>I pick good movies rather than bad ones</b>, based on reviews. If I rated every movie there was, the ratings may be normally distributed (or they may not). But when I pick movies, I consciously reject those I know would have a low rating (based on reviews), so my ratings would be more clustered around the top.</p>
<p>Even if I redefined my scale, I'd still have more than 50% above the average. This is not a contradiction. I watch a LOT of good movies with very similar ratings, and a few disastrously bad movies. The good movies will have a higher-than-average rating, and there'll be more of them than the bad movies. This is a skewed or asymmetric distribution.</p>
<p>So, <b>selective picking can wreck the normal curve</b>.</p>
<p>Yet, <b>almost everything is selectively picked</b>. Colleges try and pick the best students. Organisations tend to pick the best employees. If they rate performance, they're likely to find a bias towards the higher side -- at least, the good colleges and organisations. <b>Force fitting a normal distribution pushes down genuinely good people</b>. (In bad colleges and organisations, it pushes up genuinely bad people).</p>

  I wonder if your movie rating scale is really absolute. I can imagine 1 being "one of the greatest movies I've ever seen" and 5 being "can't get worse than that", but how about the ones in between? Do you not go "hmm, this one's nice, but not as nice as Mauna Raagam (which got a 2), so I'll give this one a 3.."?

  This really is an absolute scale. 1 means I stopped watching the movie midway. 2 - I won't watch it again. 3 - I watched it twice, but won't watch it any more (or I plan to watch it only once more). 4 - I can watch it a few times. 5 - I can watch it forever. (4 and 5 are slightly fuzzy, I admit)
