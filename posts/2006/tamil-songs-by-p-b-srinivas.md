<p>Playback singers ruled the day in the 60s and 70s. At least, I remember songs more by the singers than the music directors.</p>

<p>Here is the background music from some songs from the 1960s and 1970s, sung by <b>P B Srinivas</b>. Can you guess which <b>movie</b> they are from?</p>

<p>Don't worry about the spelling. Just spell it like it sounds, and the box will turn green.</p>

  This is for K R Ravi. The song is 'THENNANGKEETUR OONJALILE' in the movie Paadhai Theiryudhu Paar. It is there is Anand's song collection. Type the song and the movie and there you get to enjoy the song. This was the song I too was yearning to listen

  Team, do any one of you know this old song from PBS ? Kodhai un meni oliyaam kulir neeril neendhum vizhiyaam; poovil amarndha vaani; aadal therindha raani; nee kalamangaiyo....... full hindhusthani music background ? Can anyone tell me, the lyrics, the music director, movie and the lyricist ?
- **N C Phani sayee** _8 May 2012 7:26 pm_:
  As a Telugu, Iam proud of PBS ,being a Telugu but Mastered Tamil and Kannada film songs.We can find fault SPB's improper Singing in Tamil/Kannada,KJJ faulting the Tamil songs, but PBS can't be faulted for faulty spelling in singing in these languages.
- **dr.ninan koothoor** _13 Sep 2012 6:35 pm_:
  Ilamae koluvirukkum song is in the film hello mr zeminthaar ( gemini genesan movie)
- **v.s. prakasa rao** _23 Apr 2013 3:02 pm_:
  It's a great, pleasant feeling listening to PBS. Kalangalil aval vasantham, Ilamai koluvirukum, Manidan enbavan, Paadatha paattellaam padavandaal, Chinna Chinna roja, netruvarai nee yaro naan yaro, yaar yaar yaar aval yaaro, Nilave ennidam nerungade, Mayakkama(Tamil), Apara keerthi galisi etc(Kannada) and Andalu chindu mana prema, manasuloni korika, Andaalaseema manameludaama etc.(Telugu) are only some of my favourites. Thanks for this quiz which I tried only once. VSP Rao
