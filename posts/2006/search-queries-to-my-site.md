On a related note, 60% of the search queries that lead to my site this year were [Calvin and Hobbes quotes](/calvin/). "i can't help but wonder what kind of desperate straits would drive a man to invent this thing." topped the list (Calvin referring to a yo-yo), with [i always catch these trick questions](http://www.google.com/search?q=%22i+always+catch+these+trick+questions%22) following closely.

People searching for Excel related stuff were next (20%): [excel indirect(address(](http://www.google.com/search?q=excel+%22indirect%28address%28%22), [row() excel offset address](http://www.google.com/search?q=row%28%29+excel+offset+address) and the like.

A few were also looking for me by name or school (10%).

The last 10% ranged from the puzzling to the bizarre, including these gems.

- [michalengelo hidden skull](http://www.google.com/search?q=michalengelo+hidden+skull). Probably looking for the alleged hidden skull in Last Judgement.
- [googlemail access between england and india](http://www.google.com/search?q=googlemail+access+between+england+and+india). Why? Did he think there wouldn't be any?
- [greenwich meridien time for india](http://www.google.com/search?q=greenwich+meridien+time+for+india). This is usually the same in Greenwich and in India. Rest of the world too.
- [origin of monkey in fez](http://www.google.com/search?q=origin+of+monkey+in+fez). What?
- [address of sexy girl in ahmedabad](http://www.google.com/search?q=address+of+sexy+girl+in+ahmedabad). But why **my** site?
- [address of tool makers for converting html to xml in chennai](http://www.google.com/search?q=address+of+tool+makers+for+converting+html+to+xml+in+chennai). Do they have a license to convert?
