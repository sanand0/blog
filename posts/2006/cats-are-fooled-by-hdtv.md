[Cats are fooled by HDTV](http://www.collisiondetection.net/mt/archives/2006/01/why_cats_love_h.html). Our cat tends to ignore normal TV completely. Guess HDTV looks real enough.

  I see you have given Ender's Game 5 stars. Have you read Dune? You might like that too.

  I HAVE read Dune. Thought it was quite different, but I didn't like it as much as Ender's Game, though. I started off on Dragonlance, but gave up mid-way. Now I'm reading Terry Pratchett.

  For more than one reason, i dont like Terry Pratchett, though I have read a lot of his books.. Always feel he's ripped off Tolkien. Stephen King's Dark Tower series, Dune are all pretty good.

  Haven't tried the Dark Tower series. Will give that a shot.
- **Dhar** _24 Jan 2006 3:12 am_:
  Errr... Pratchett's books are a work of parody. I wouldn't be too surprised to find passages which seem to be "lifted" out of works of Tolkien and others...
- **S Anand** _24 Jan 2006 5:44 pm_:
  Haven't read enough to spot lifted passages... let me see I can spot them :-)

  Check the [Annotated Terry Pratchett file](www.co.uk.lspace.org/books/apf/).
