I got an invite for [Google Spreadsheets](http://spreadsheets.google.com/). Very impressive AJAX interface.

  Tried Google Spreadsheets. Love the concept, but I seem to be missing the Grand Picture. How is Google going to integrate things like Calendar, Spreadsheets, Notebook, Browser Sync to give us an "Aha" moment? The glue that should hold these applications together seems to be missing. Quite a few of them are very average and scratch the itch for a small section of web population. Nothing earthshaking like Gmail or search. :(

  Funnily, the very apps you mentioned (Calendar, Notebook, Spreadsheets and Browser Sync) are the ones I use the most -- as much as GMail and search! You're right, there isn't much integration, except perhaps between Calendar and GMail. Maybe it's coming. But even as standalone apps, I'm surprised at how much I use them. I'll write about how I'm using these sometime...
