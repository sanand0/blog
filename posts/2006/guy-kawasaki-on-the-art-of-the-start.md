[Video of Guy Kawasaki's talk on The Art of the Start](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-3755718939216161559) at TiECon 2006.

It's informative, even if you don't want to start a venture, but I didn't know Guy was such a funny speaker! He begins with:

> Early in my career, I sat through many keynote speeches -- at Comdex, at Mac Road Expo. I saw many many hi-tech CEOs speak, and I have to tell you, one thing I noticed is they pretty much sucked as speakers. And the second thing that I figured out sitting in these audiences of sucky keynotes is that if there's anything that's worse than a CEO who sucks as a speaker, it's a CEO who sucks as a speaker and you have no idea how much longer he or she will suck! And so, I have adopted the top 10 format for all of my speeches. This way, if you think I suck, at least you can track progress through my speech.

Towards then end, when he's run well over time...

> What are you going to do? Not invite me again?

He gets dragged off the stage.
