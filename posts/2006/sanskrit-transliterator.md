I've built a simple [Sanskrit transliterator](/Sanskrit_transliterator.html). You can type in words in English and it will spell them out in Sanskrit. You can copy-paste the Tamil above into Microsoft Word, etc.

Browse through my [Javascript](http://transliterate.googlecode.com/) to see how it works. Feel free to reuse.

  Good work, wonder how many use Sanskrit these days though! One more thing, specific to Mac users, is that Indic support is still not mature for Firefox. Safari, the inbuilt browser does a decent job though. There was an extra "S" that was appearing after each letter in Safari.

  Good tool, but the transliteration scheme should be replaced by more standard one.

  nice one buddy!!although how would you deal with ambiguities like "om" ?
- **Anand** _28 Aug 2006 12:00 pm_:
  Hmm, I wonder...can you please check if the small ''i'' maatra works fine? I gave the word ''janani'' and the ''i'' gave me the maatra AFTER the second ''na'', while it should be BEFORE. The big ''ii''/''I'' works fine. Also words like ''chithram'' etc - basically wherever there is a small ''i''!
