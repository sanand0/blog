<p>Microsoft adCenter Labs has a <a href="http://adlab.microsoft.com/DPUI/DPUI.aspx">demographics prediction engine</a>. Based on a person's search queries and web sites visited, it can predict their gender and age.</p>
<p>So I tried that on parts of the body, to see what men were interested in vs women.</p>
<table class="numbers lines">
<tr><th>topic</th><th>male</th><th>female</th></tr>
<tr><td>hair</td><td>25%</td><td>75%</td></tr>
<tr><td>eyes</td><td>33%</td><td>67%</td></tr>
<tr><td>cheek</td><td>33%</td><td>67%</td></tr>
<tr><td>hands</td><td>33%</td><td>67%</td></tr>
<tr><td>lips</td><td>36%</td><td>64%</td></tr>
<tr><td>ears</td><td>39%</td><td>61%</td></tr>
<tr><td>fingers</td><td>40%</td><td>60%</td></tr>
<tr><td>forehead</td><td>42%</td><td>58%</td></tr>
<tr><td>nose</td><td>43%</td><td>57%</td></tr>
<tr><td>neck</td><td>46%</td><td>54%</td></tr>
<tr><td>beard</td><td>55%</td><td>45%</td></tr>
<tr><td>moustache</td><td>58%</td><td>42%</td></tr>
<tr><td>leg</td><td>60%</td><td>40%</td></tr>
<tr><td>palm</td><td>61%</td><td>39%</td></tr>
<tr><td>toe</td><td>64%</td><td>36%</td></tr>
</table>
<p>While I can understand men being more interested in beards and moustaches (perhaps even legs), why are they far more interested in toes than women?</p>

  Hey Anand, a quick question.\
  Are you using Google Spreadsheets? Yesterday, I realized that after the initial enthu, I have not visited the site. This makes me wonder if Google Spreadsheets in itself is a powerful enough solution to attract the masses.

  As pointed out by someone on Slashdot, try using the URL http://www.google.com/ as the input and you will get "Female Oriented with following Confidence: Female 1.00, Male 0.00"
