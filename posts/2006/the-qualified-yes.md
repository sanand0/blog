[The qualified Yes](http://www.43folders.com/2006/01/06/modest-change-qualified-yes/). Somewhere between saying "no" to a new project or taking on something in an open-ended type of way, be clear from the start on what you can commit in concrete terms.

> So, what used to be "Sure, I'll do your web site" is now more often "Sure, I'll give you 10 hours and 3 calls over the next month to use however you want." If nothing else, it helps everyone understand that time is a precious commodity, but it also gets me out of being the de facto manager for every aspect of a project I touch.
