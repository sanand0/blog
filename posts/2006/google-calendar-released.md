[Google Calendar](http://calendar.google.com/) is out. But for some reason, it's too slow for me.

  You are right. It was too frigging slow in the beginning. But after the initial wait, things worked out. :))

  Do you still see it being slow?

  It loads slowly, but is OK now. I'm having problems importing data in the iCal format, though.
