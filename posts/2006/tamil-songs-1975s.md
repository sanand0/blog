<p>Ilayaraja scored Annakkili in 1975, and ruled Tamil film music for 15 years as <i>isai gnaani</i>. He took the mantle from MSV, who continued to score great melodies until 1980.</p>

<p>Here is the background music from some hit songs between 1975 - 1980. Can you guess which <b>movie</b> they are from? (Some films appear <b>twice</b>)</p>

<p>Don't worry about the spelling. Just spell it like it sounds, and the box will turn green.</p>

  Oops, looks like I forgot to upload those 5. I'll get that done by 6pm GMT.

  Anand, The boxes are not turning green for 18. I think you need to provide more spelling options. I managed to find out that you have given a space between the two words for #6. even in #17 there is a space between the first two words. I also struggled a lot for 5. you should introduced an option with the letter t instead of k. any clues for songs 12, 21 & 22? I have also managed to find 17 / 20.
- **S Anand** _9 May 2006 10:06 am_:
  Funny, I thought I was ignoring spaces. I did think of the 't' option vs 'k' option for #5... will implement that. As for clues, I'm afraid I'm at office now -- can't hear the songs, and don't remember the order. Will post clues by end of day.

  At least a couple of songs are not playing right now. will come back later. Terrific stuff! Thanks.
- **S Anand** _9 May 2006 10:51 am_:
  Hopefully, it's all fixed now.

  15/25. Failed - 9, 12, 14, 16, 18, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25. Got 21 and 22 coz you said some movies appear twice ;). So, am not counting that. 18, 24 - the songs are way too obv, but i am struggling to recollect the films :(
- **Kaps** _9 May 2006 11:47 am_:
  Anand, 24/25 this time. I'm having problems cracking the spelling for #18. I'm quite confident of the movie. Once this is set right, my score would be a perfect 25. You might consider giving an option for the letter v instead of g in #23.
- **zero** _9 May 2006 11:57 am_:
  Death to me for not finding out 18.\
  Kaps, I guess Anand will not be considering that ;)\
  Googled for 24, the other got-the-song-not-the-movie one.
- **sudheer** _9 May 2006 1:32 pm_:

- **srivatsan** _10 May 2006 2:45 am_:
  song no. 18 is kanmaniye kadhal enbadhu from aarilirundhu arupadhu varai (that's what i guess) but the answer doesn't turn green?
- **zero** _10 May 2006 5:05 am_:
  prakash, you are right. It turns on for 'aruvathu'
- **Vijay** _10 May 2006 5:15 am_:
  Try "aarilirundhu aruVadhu varai".

  good one.. except for the slight juggling for spelling for 21.. Isn't it 't' instead of 'v'?
