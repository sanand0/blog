  Not convinced with the comparison. Looks like the chappie Renald is just using to blog to promote BTJunkie. Checked the features of BTJunkie, they are nowhere close to Torrentspy, yet it gets a rating of 9. No way anyone can confirm BTJunkies claims like Torrents Indexed, Torrents Added Daily etc. Neither does the author specify how he confirmed these points.\

  **"At first I thought BTJunkie's numbers must be fake, but I assure you it is real! I tested the number posted with the number in the actual directory for the day and they matched for a week straight!"**\

  Yeah, sure!

  Does sound like a plug, doesn't it? :-) I'm planning to do a test myself. Why don't you try one too?

  A solid rebuttal. I tried BTJunkie last week. Wasn't very impressed. And the few movies I couldn't find anywhere else, I couldn't find here either.
