I was travelling on the Jubilee line, just pulling into Stratford (the last stop), when I heard this announcement.

> "The next station is Stratford, where this train terminates. Thank you for travelling on the Jubilee line, and I hope you have a very pleasant evening."
>
> (pause)
>
> "Unless, of course, you were the person who pulled the passenger alarm at Westminster, in which case I don't care what kind of an evening you have."
