Fred Gratzon's [advice on work](http://lazyway.blogs.com/lazy_way/2006/06/your_calling_an.html)

> I just do what I want to do and learn what I want to learn and enjoy what I want to enjoy and sometimes I get so wonderfully and powerfully caught up in some project and I start dreaming expansive daydreams and I go for it with every ounce of energy and enthusiasm and love that I can muster.
>
> And the money . . . it just takes care of itself.
