Had tea at the Ritz today. Initially, after reading that "Gentlemen are politely requested to keep their jackets and ties on during tea", my reaction was rather like Calvin's.

But the tea (Earl Grey) was outstanding. So were the scones, sandwiches and desserts. Although most people were ladies above 60, the younger ones were among the most beautiful I've seen in London.
