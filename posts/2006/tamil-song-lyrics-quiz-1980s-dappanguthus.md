<p>Here are words from the middle of 10 songs from 1980-1990. They are all <i>dappanguthus</i> -- or at least, fast songs. Can you guess which <b>movie</b> they are from?</p>

<p>Note: I've made this quiz <b>a little tougher</b> than the earlier ones.</p>

<p>Don't worry about the spelling. Just spell it like it sounds, and the box will turn green.</p>
