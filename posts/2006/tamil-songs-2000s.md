<p>The 2000s saw the proliferation of music directors like Vidyasagar, Harris Jayaraj and Yuvan Shankar Raja, while Rahman still continued strong.</p>

<p>Here is the background music from some hit songs from the 2000s. Can you guess which <b>movie</b> they are from?</p>

<p>Don't worry about the spelling. Just spell it like it sounds, and the box will turn green.</p>
