<p>In 1992, A R Rahman emerged. Ilayaraja may have scored more tunes until the first 3 years of the decade than Rahman did the whole decade. But the decade belonged to Rahman.</p>

<p>Here is the background music from some hit songs from the 1990s. Can you guess which <b>movie</b> they are from?</p>

<p>Don't worry about the spelling. Just spell it like it sounds, and the box will turn green.</p>
