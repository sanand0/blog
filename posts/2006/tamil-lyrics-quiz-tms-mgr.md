<p>Here are words from the middle of 8 songs TMS has sung for MGR. Can you guess which <b>movie</b> they are from?</p>

<p>Don't worry about the spelling. Just spell it like it sounds, and the box will turn green.</p>

  "Ellam enakul erunthalum ennai thannakkul vaithirukkum "

  You're probably referring to [Ulagam Pirandhadhu Enakkaaga from Paasam](http://www.s-anand.net/tamil/ulagam+pirandhadhu). Got it by [googling](http://www.google.com/search?q=).

  I really enjoyed this and i love to do for MGR related quizzes. But sad thing is that i am not able to find answer for one question:-(. My evergreen hero is MGR and i love to watch all MGR movies. What a charismatic person he is!
- **Rangan** _15 Oct 2009 1:04 pm_:
  Particularly i love to watch movies like Nadodi Mannan, Thirudathe, Enga Veetu Pillai, Adimai Pen, Aayirathil Oruvan, Ninaithadai Mudippavan, Anbe Vaa, Ullagam Suttrum Valiban, Rikshawkkaran, Rajakumari, Arasakattalai, Madhuraiveeran, Mannadhi Mannan, Kalangarai Vilakkam, Nadodi, Kudiyirindha Kovil, Padagotti etc etc. Some movies may be missed out from this list. I have watched all the above movies more than 20 times. I like his bunny cheeks when he laughs. This kind of cheeks only madhavan (maddy) is having after MGR and this is told by famous director Manirathnam.
