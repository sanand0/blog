GPT-5 (Codex) follows instructions exactly as given. Usually a good thing, but sometimes, it this is what happens.

**AGENTS.md**: ALWAYS WRITE TESTS before coding.

**Codex**: Let me begin with the tests. (Spends 5 minutes writing tests.)

**Anand**: Stop! This is a proof of concept. We don't need tests!

**AGENTS.md**: Write tests before coding. Drop tests for proof-of-concepts.

**Codex**: (Proceeds to delete all existing tests.)

**Anand**: STOP! We need those tests!

---

**AGENTS.md**: For new code, or if tests exist, start by writing tests.

**Anand**: Do this task. ... BUT SKIP TESTS! This is a POC!

**Codex**: The user has explicitly asked to skip tests. But the guidelines require tests for new code. For now, I think I will skip tests.

**Anand**: (sigh!)

Reminds me of Chaplin's Feeding Machine.
