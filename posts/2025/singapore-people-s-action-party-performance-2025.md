What percentage of seats does the #Singapore People's Action Party win?

Normally, this is a 2-hour programmatic data-scraping + data visualization exercise, ideal for a data journalism class.

Now, it's a 2-minute question to O3-Mini-High.

_Search online for the historical results of all the Singapore elections and show me a table and chart of the number and percentage of the seats won by People's Action Party_.

It "manually" read the Wikipedia page for each election, then wrote a Python script to draw the chart.

Now, a non-psephologist like me can explore implications rather than process. Like:

- Why a 1963 slump then instant sweep?
- Four consecutive 100 % victories (1965 - 1980!)
- Seat count growth masks percentage dips?
- 2020 is PAP's lowest seat share in six decades -- which is still 89%!

A big win for #datajournalism

"PS: My stream is filled with posts like these. "Earlier, this would have cost $1000X or taken 100X more time." The subtler point is, "Earlier, it wasn't practical." This isn't efficiency. It's **alchemy.**
