Wow. Every SINGLE person in the audience at this (Healthcare Education, Singapore) conference was on a laptop, tablet, or mobile. Some on multiple devices.

I guess this is the new model of learning and listening.

The only people who were NOT on a device were on stage. The speakers.

I guess it's up to me to fix that 🙂
