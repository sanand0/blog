I'm at an open Hyderabad meet-up, Thu 20 Mar 4 pm. "Analyzing data with AI agents"."

It's a public event by Hasgeek. Venue: Castlight Health, Sattva Knowledge Park.

We know LLMs suck at number crunching but are good with code. I'll share what we've learnt by getting it to write code to analyze data instead.

Less lecturing, more interactive Q&A and demos in a cozy group. Mostly for analysts, data scientists, and programmers. Not so much for LLM researchers or managers.
