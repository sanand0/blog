Software companies build "SaaS"-like apps today. Agents _will_ replace apps. Instead of UI, workflows, and app logic, they'll engineer prompts, APIs, and evals. "

But apps need **domain** _and_ **code**.

LLMs are crushing the coding workload. This lowers cost of development, increasing ROI (so there'll hopefully be more demand).

So, will domain matter more? It might seem so. But most actually people use LLMs more as a domain expert than a coder.

I think **LLMs will eat domain work too** in software. Sure, we need domain expertise. But domain agents can fill that gap (maybe leading to even more demand).

But today, a great thing to do is to get a domain expert and a coder together in front of LLMs + coding agents and pair-program. Fantastically productive and creative.
