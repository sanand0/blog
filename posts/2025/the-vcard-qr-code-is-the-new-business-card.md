[Arindam Roy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roy-arindam/) suggested a business idea post-COVID: an online QR code for business cards.

The benefits are clear. Never print or carry cards. The scanned card goes straight to the other person's contacts. There might be social metrics we could capture as well.

That idea never got past the discussion stage, though I've begged for it a few times. Last year, I decided to use existing tools to solve the problem. My current approach: generate a **vCard QR code**.

vCard is the format contacts are stored. Most phones, including iOS and Android, support it. It holds basic information like name, mobile, email, company, website, etc.

Sites like [QR Code Monkey](https://www.qrcode-monkey.com/#vcard) let you enter the details and give you a QR code image. I added this to my phone desktop as a photo widget.

Now, when I meet someone, I open my phone, show the QR code, they scan it, and my details are added as a contact. No paper. No typing. Instant updates 😎
