Tomorrow, we'll be vibe-analyzing data at a Hasgeek Fifth Elephant workshop.

It's a follow-up to my DataHack Summit talk "RIP Data Scientists". I showed how it's possible to automate many data science tasks. In this workshop, the audience will be doing that.

Slides: https://sanand0.github.io/talks/2025-09-16-vibe-analysis/ (minimal because... well, it's "vibe analysis". We'll code as we go.)

Here are datasets I'll suggest to the audience:

- India Census 2011: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danofer/india-census
- MovieLens movies: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/32m/
- IMDb movies: https://datasets.imdbws.com/
- Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS): https://www.bls.gov/oes/tables.htm
- Global AI Job Market & Salary Trends 2025: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bismasajjad/global-ai-job-market-and-salary-trends-2025
