I'm off for a 10-day Vipassana meditation program.

- **WHAT**? A 10-day residential meditation. No phone, laptop, or speaking. https://www.dhamma.org/
- **WHEN**? From today until next Sunday (13 July)
- **WHERE**? Near Chennai. https://maps.app.goo.gl/PnGkLoZ8U6aG2RKk8
- **WHY**? I've heard good things and am curious.
- **SURE**? I've never been away from tech for this long. Let's see!

I've scheduled LinkedIn posts, so you'll still see stuff. But I won't be replying.
