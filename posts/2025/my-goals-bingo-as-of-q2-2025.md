![My Goals Bingo as of Q2 2025](/blog/assets/ChatGPT-Image-Apr-1-2025-11_27_34-AM.webp)

[In 2025, I’m playing Goals Bingo](/blog/my-year-in-2024/). I want to complete one row or column of these goals. Here’s my status from Jan – Jun 2025.

🟢 indicates I’m on track and **likely** to complete.
🟡 indicates I’m behind but I **may be** able to hit it.
🔴 indicates I’m behind and it’s **looking hard**.

At the moment, there's no row or column that looks like a definite win.

Observations:

- **New goals goals seem likely**. I like doing new things.
- **Stretch goals are least likely**. I'n not so good at follow-up or scaling
- **People goals seem likely**. Mild surprise.
- **Wealth seems least likely**. No surprise. I haven’t started doing anything about it 🤷🏽‍♂️.
