<p>In 1995, I wrote down the specs for my "dream machine". Comparing it against the machine I have today:</p>
<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><thead><tr><th>Item</th><th>1995</th><th>2025</th><th>Increase</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>RAM</td><td>32 MB</td><td>64 GB</td><td>2000</td></tr><tr><td>GPU RAM</td><td>16 MB</td><td>8 GB</td><td>500</td></tr><tr><td>HDD</td><td>4 GB</td><td>1 TB</td><td>250</td></tr><tr><td>HDD speed</td><td>10 MB/s</td><td>2 GB/s</td><td>200</td></tr><tr><td>Processor</td><td>150 MHz</td><td>5.10 GHz</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td>Monitor</td><td>21"</td><td>27"</td><td>1.3</td></tr><tr><td>Resolution</td><td>2048x1536</td><td>1920x1200</td><td>0.73</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>Clearly, RAM has seen the biggest growth. Low cost, high demand.<br/>Followed by the hard disk - both on capacity and speed.</p>
<p>The processor speed increase, in comparison, is modest.</p>
<p>What's surprising is that my monitor today isn't that much bigger than what I wanted. The resolution is actually <em>lower</em> than what I wanted 30 years ago! Clearly, I overestimated how important screen resolution would be.</p>
