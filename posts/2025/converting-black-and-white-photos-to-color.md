Sometimes, technology creates truly memorable moments.

Like when email connected me with my schoolmates in 1993.\
Or WhatsApp connected me with long-lost relatives in 2010.

Today, Google Gemini took me back 55 years, converting the grainy black-and-white wedding photos of my parents into vivid high-resolution color images.

So many people. Much younger. More alive.

I look forward to when I can watch the video. Move around. Talk to them...

- **Prompt**: _Convert this black and white photo to color. CAREFULLY ensure that the photo, especially faces, are EXACTLY the same. Use vivid colors and sharp photography, like in modern digital photos._
- **Model**: gemini-2.5-flash-image (nano-banana)
- **Temperature**: 0
