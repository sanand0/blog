![AfterSlides: Write Slides After Talks](/blog/assets/image-10.webp)

25 years ago, Mr. Krishnan (IAS) amused us with anecdotes of bureaucrats writing meeting minutes **before** the meeting.

This week, I flipped that. I wrote slides **after** the talk. I call them **AfterSlides**.

**Why.** I ran a couple of Ask-Me-Anything (AMA) sessions where the audience set the agenda. I learned their interests. They got answers. No slides prepared.

**How.** I okayed recording with the organizers, recorded on my phone, transcribed with Gemini, and asked ChatGPT to generate the AfterSlides.

Here are a few AfterSlides from AMAs at:

GALE: https://sanand0.github.io/talks/2025-09-15-llm-ama-gale/\
BI Worldwide: https://sanand0.github.io/talks/2025-09-18-llm-ama-bi-worldwide/

I see potential for this in:

1. **Education.** Turn teacher lectures into AfterSlides students can revise. Add a quiz.
2. **Management.** Turn reviews into AfterSlides for reference and action.
3. **Sales.** Turn pitches into Afterslides for clients to revisit
4. **Research.** Turn interviews into evidence AfterSlides with citations.
5. **Support.** Turn calls into policy/FAQ slides your team can search.

There's **derived** content that LLMs can generate.

- **Quizzes.** Non-trivial questions to test understanding.
- **Errata.** Fact-check, cite sources, add confidence.
- **Counterpoints.** Add credible alternative views with references.
- **Feedback.** What worked, what to improve.

**Prompts I used.**
