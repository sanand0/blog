My VizChitra talk on **Data** **Design** **by** **Dialog** was on LLMs helping in every stage of data storytelling.

Main **takeaways**:

- After open data, LLMs may the single biggest act of data democratization. https://youtu.be/hPH5_ulHtno?t=01m24s
- LLMs can help in every step of the (data) value chain. https://youtu.be/hPH5_ulHtno?t=00m47s
- LLMs are bad with numbers. Have them write code instead. https://youtu.be/hPH5_ulHtno?t=06m33s
- Don't confuse it. Just ask it again. https://youtu.be/hPH5_ulHtno?t=05m30s
- If it doesn't work, throw it away and redo it. https://youtu.be/hPH5_ulHtno?t=20m02s
- Keep an impossibility list. Revisit it whenever a new model drops. https://youtu.be/hPH5_ulHtno?t=20m02s
- Never ask for just one output from an LLM. Ask for a dozen. https://youtu.be/hPH5_ulHtno?t=22m20s
- Our imagination is the limit. https://youtu.be/hPH5_ulHtno?t=26m35s
- Two years ago, they were like grade 8 students. Today, a postgraduate. https://youtu.be/hPH5_ulHtno?t=00m47s
- Do as little as possible. Just wait. Models will catch up. https://youtu.be/hPH5_ulHtno?t=31m45s

**Funny** bits:

- This is how it's done. How else would we do it? https://youtu.be/hPH5_ulHtno?t=04m31s
- Some people call biases domain expertise. https://youtu.be/hPH5_ulHtno?t=22m50s
- I don't like work. I like playing Bubbles. So, have _it_ do the work. https://youtu.be/hPH5_ulHtno?t=23m08s
- More metrics, more quirky! https://youtu.be/hPH5_ulHtno?t=26m20s
- Amuse me! https://youtu.be/hPH5_ulHtno?t=21m37s
