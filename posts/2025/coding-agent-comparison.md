I asked multiple coding agents and models to build the same app:

> Create a single-page web app at `index`.`html` that beautifully renders a GitHub user profile and activity comprehensively. Pick the ID in the URL ?`id`=..., default to ?`id`=`torvalds`.

... and compared their quality, cost, and speed.

My observations:

**Quality variance is the highest**. Some models / agents produce great visuals, some average, some fail completely.

**Cost and time variance are lower** among the successful models. About 2X variance in each.

This is unlike non-code usage, where quality varies _less_ than cost.

My takeaway: **Pick the best model** / **agent**. Don't worry about speed and cost - the variance is lower.
