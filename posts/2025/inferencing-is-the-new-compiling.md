"Inferencing" is the new "Compiling!"

I spent a fair bit of today playing Bubble Shooter because Claude spent 10 minutes writing code for an npm package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/saveform and for a bunch of other things.

5-10 minutes is too short a time to do something meaningful. I do wish these LLMs would take less or more time. We're right now in the zone of bad interruption timing.
