I don't charge for workshops. Altruism? No: it's self-interest.

"If you're not paying for it, you're not the customer; you're the product being sold." [Andrew Lewis, via Tim O'Reilly, 2010](https://x.com/timoreilly/status/22823381903).

My workshop process is designed to benefit me first.

**I pick topics I want to learn**, not stuff useful to the audience. Example: I picked DuckDB for my [PyCon India 2025 talk](https://github.com/sanand0/talks/tree/main/2025-09-13-duckdb-is-the-new-pandas) to learn it.

**I experiment on the audience**. Example: I tried [voice-vibe-modeling](https://youtu.be/xZpdwLHW40o?t=1538) in my [RIP Data Scientists talk](https://sanand0.github.io/talks/2025-08-21-rip-data-scientists/). Experiments fail often, e.g. vibe-coding Minecraft in PyCon IN 2023.

**I learn from the audience**. Example: [Rakesh Roshan's K-fetish is statistically significant](https://sanand0.github.io/talks/2025-09-16-vibe-analysis/#13), via my [Vibe Analysis workshop](https://sanand0.github.io/talks/2025-09-16-vibe-analysis/).

**I collect data** from the audience. Example: [How student copy](https://sanand0.github.io/tds-2024-sep-project-2-results/similar.html).

**I gather ideas**. Example: [skills AI will replace](https://youtu.be/sSyBUSuLduQ?t=1251), from my [IITM DOMS commencement talk](https://sanand0.github.io/talks/2025-07-13-goodbye-mba-hello-ai/).

**I publish these**, too, with [recordings and transcripts](https://sanand0.github.io/talks/).

LLMs let me do **more** such stuff:

- **LLM simulations**. We play an LLM-driven case. I learn from the choices.
- **LLM Q&A talks**. Audience questions → LLM → live slides.
- **Cluster polls**. Audience answers a question. We cluster live and learn.
- **Compare models**. I show multiple answers to same question. You votes. We review diffs.
- **Learn code prompting**. You build the same app with your own prompts. We analyze what works.
- **Security testing**. Try to jailbreak or inject prompts. We map what works and why.

If your HR team or college is OK with all the above, ping me. I'm game for a free talk / workshop!
