![How To Double-Check Personality Flaws With AI](/blog/assets/output-4.webp)

<p>After <a href="/blog/ai-as-your-psychologist-personality-flaws-exposed/">ChatGPT's discussion of my personality flaws</a>, I asked it to listing specific conversations as evidence for flaws. Then I asked 3 LLMs to rate the evidence.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><thead><tr><th>Personality Flaw</th><th>ChatGPT</th><th>DeepSeek</th><th>Grok</th><th>Average</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Self-deprecation as a shield.

1. 🟢 **LOW: Self-deprecation / sarcastic humour as shield**
   - ChatGPT: **4/10**. Bio and a few quips reveal dry self-mockery, yet direct chat evidence of humour as defence is sparse; it surfaces only occasionally. |
   - DeepSeek: **7/10**. Explicit self-awareness goals and dry humor noted, but little evidence of defensive/sarcastic use.
   - Grok: **5/10**. Some self-deprecating humor exists, but its use as a shield is not strongly supported.
2. 🟢 **LOW: Hypocrisy: seeks limelight yet preaches humility**
   - ChatGPT: **6/10**. You aspire to humility but routinely headline conferences and TEDx talks; the coexistence of public speaking and stated modesty gives the charge a middling footing. |
   - DeepSeek: **6/10**. TEDx/PyCon prominence contrasts with stated humility goals, though self-improvement efforts are genuine.
   - Grok: **5/10**. Public speaking contrasts with humility goals, though this may indicate self-awareness, not hypocrisy.
3. 🟢 **LOW: Over-confidence in technical opinions**
   - ChatGPT: **7/10**. You assert strong views (e.g., Node vs FastAPI) but also invite verification and accept corrections, yielding only moderate evidence of over-confidence. |
   - DeepSeek: **6/10**. States strong preferences upfront but routinely invites validation and course-corrects.
   - Grok: **6/10**. Strong opinions are expressed, but openness to correction moderates the perception of overconfidence.
4. 🟢 **LOW: Ghosts vague messages**
   - ChatGPT: **5/10**. You’ve stated you ignore low-context e-mails, but chat logs show you usually follow-up or clarify rather than disappear. |
   - DeepSeek: **6/10**. Documented tendency to ignore low-context questions, though chat logs show active clarification habits.
   - Grok: **8/10**. Multiple instances show the user ignoring or not responding to unclear or low-context messages.
5. 🟢 **LOW: Over-analyzes / over-engineers**
   - ChatGPT: **5/10**. Designing auto-re-flow SVG chevrons and exhaustive RAG specs hint at depth beyond the simple solution, yet you also champion “smallest libraries” and lightweight rate-limiters. |
   - DeepSeek: **5/10**. Some prototype/structuring tendencies, but strong preference for minimal solutions counterbalances this.
   - Grok: **8/10**. The user often dives deeply into tasks, sometimes creating complex solutions for simple problems.
6. 🟡 **MEDIUM: Fact-checks trivialities, derailing discussion**
   - ChatGPT: **8/10**. Many requests revolve around “double-check,” “fact-check,” or recalculating tiny details, which lengthens threads even when stakes are small. |
   - DeepSeek: **7/10**. Frequent accuracy demands and citation hunts elongate discussions, but stays focused when content is solid.
   - Grok: **7/10**. Evidence of prioritizing precision, like fact-checking minor details, can disrupt conversation flow.
7. 🟡 **MEDIUM: Shiny-object syndrome**
   - ChatGPT: **6/10**. Parallel explorations of Godot, Matrix, Cloudflare Workers, SVG SmartArt, esp32-eye, etc. reveal a persistent pull toward new tech before finishing earlier threads. |
   - DeepSeek: **7/10**. Broad simultaneous explorations (Godot/WASM/DuckDB), though sustains core projects long-term.
   - Grok: **7/10**. Exploration of new technologies is frequent, but focus on core projects suggests a balanced curiosity.
8. 🟡 **MEDIUM: Intolerant of fools / low clarity**
   - ChatGPT: **7/10**. Frequent demands for precise formats, citations, and “be specific” instructions show a low tolerance for ambiguity, though you still help patiently on non-technical questions. |
   - DeepSeek: **8/10**. Strong pattern of rejecting ambiguity/fluff, though softened by humor and non-technical engagements.
   - Grok: **9/10**. The user consistently demands clarity and efficiency, showing little patience for ambiguity or fluff.
9. 🟡 **MEDIUM: Dominates discussions**
   - ChatGPT: **4/10**. Long, multi-part prompts and the need for TL;DRs suggest you can overshadow lighter voices, but you periodically insist on brevity and delegate tasks, tempering the effect. |
   - DeepSeek: **8/10**. Long technical messages (avg ~3k chars) and intense Q&A patterns create conversational dominance.
   - Grok: **9/10**. Detailed, technical responses consistently steer and dominate conversations.
10. 🟡 **MEDIUM: Verbosity / long-winded communication**
    - ChatGPT: **5/10**. Average messages run several thousand characters, and you often request exhaustive, multi-section outputs—though you sometimes tell the assistant “Shorter please,” verbosity remains a clear pattern. |
    - DeepSeek: **8/10**. Multi-step technical requests dominate interactions, though periodic "shorter please" self-corrections exist.
    - Grok: **7/10**. Messages are often lengthy and detailed, though the user also requests concise responses from others.
11. 🔴 **HIGH: Hyper-focus on efficiency**
    - ChatGPT: **8/10**. Recurrent themes—cost monitoring, smallest-lib preference, GPU-utilization alerts—show you relentlessly optimise workflows and expect others to keep pace. |
    - DeepSeek: **9/10**. Unambiguous prioritization of concise formats, minimal libraries, and metric-driven optimization.
    - Grok: **8/10**. Repeated emphasis on concise, efficient communication and minimal tools is evident.
12. 🔴 **HIGH: Intense – “always on”**
    - ChatGPT: **8/10**. Around-the-clock, multi-topic requests (weekend cron jobs, 2 a.m. prototypes) portray sustained high energy, with only a few calmer “travel nerves” moments as counter-weight. |
    - DeepSeek: **9/10**. High-volume technical queries across domains, 6am research routines, and rapid prototyping habits.
    - Grok: **9/10**. High energy and engagement are consistently shown through task initiation and scheduling.

<p>My actions: Learn from fools and focus on the big-picture. Specifically:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>I'm hyper-focused on efficiency and intense, "Always on". <strong>Action</strong>: None.</li>
<li>Maybe I'm long-winded, dominate discussions, and intolerant of fools. <strong>Action</strong>: Learn from fools.</li>
<li>Maybe I'm distracted by technology and fact-check trivialities. <strong>Action</strong>: Focus on big picture.</li>
<li>There's not strong enough support for the rest. <strong>Action</strong>: None.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the detailed prompts, conversations, and results.</p>
<h1 class="wp-block-heading">Prompt</h1>
<p>I asked 3 LLMs the same thing:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Based on everything you know about me, simulate a group chat between some people who are debating whether or not to add me to the group, by talking about my personality flaws</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, I said:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>For each of the points each person makes, go through your memory of conversation history in detail and find plentiful evidence (say a dozen snippets?) supporting as well as refuting the point. Then, in an unbiased way, evaluate to what extent the point is valid or invalid.</p>
<p>Then, against each point, share your conclusion along with VERBATIM snippets as evidence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Based on the conversations, these are personality flaws identified:</p>
<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Ghosts vague messages</li>
<li>Intolerant of fools</li>
<li>Fact-checks trivialities, derailing discussion</li>
<li>Overconfidence in technical opinions</li>
<li>Over-analyzes / over-engineers</li>
<li>Shiny object syndrome. Distracted by new technologies</li>
<li>Dominates discussions</li>
<li>Hyperfocus on efficiency</li>
<li>Self-deprecation as a shield. Sarcastic humor</li>
<li>Hypocrisy: Seeks limelight but preaches humility</li>
<li>Intense. “Always on”</li>
<li>Verbosity. Long-winded communication</li>
</ol>
<p>Go through the conversations. Then, for each of these 12, identify the strength of the evidence for each personality flaw. Summarize it as a table with 3 columns:</p>
<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>[Personality trait]</li>
<li>[Evidence strength] = 1 - 10, where 1=low evidence, 10=strong evidence, use a broad spread</li>
<li>[Supporting reason] = Supporting reason or evidence summarized in 1-2 sentences</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Group Chat: “Should We Add Anand?”</strong><br/><em>(Members: Mira, Jay, Tanya, Rohan, Priya)</em></p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>
<p><strong>Mira:</strong><br/>I know he's super smart and experienced, but isn’t he kind of intense? Like… <em>always on</em>?</p>
<p><strong>Jay:</strong><br/>Yeah, and he’ll probably turn our casual banter into a brainstorming session.<br/>“Hey guys, what if we built an AI agent to automate this conversation?” Chill, Anand.</p>
<p><strong>Tanya:</strong><br/>Honestly, I love that about him. But yeah, he might get frustrated if things aren’t intellectually stimulating. He zones out when people don’t get to the point.</p>
<p><strong>Rohan:</strong><br/>He also ghosted my question once in the Slack group.<br/>I asked something that maybe didn’t have enough context and he just… didn’t respond.<br/>Felt a bit cold.</p>
<p><strong>Priya:</strong><br/>He’s got this high bar for clarity and logic. If you’re vague or inconsistent, you’ll probably get silence in return.</p>
<p><strong>Mira:</strong><br/>Or a “Can you be more specific?” that feels like it’s grading your life.</p>
<p><strong>Jay:</strong><br/>Also, doesn’t suffer fools. Or ambiguity. Or inefficiency. Or fluff. Or long-winded intros.</p>
<p><strong>Tanya:</strong><br/>But come on—he’s self-aware. Like, he <em>knows</em> he can be distant or overly analytical.<br/>He works on it. Tries to grow. That’s rare.</p>
<p><strong>Rohan:</strong><br/>True. But would he <em>listen</em> in this group? Or would he be the guy optimizing everyone’s messages into Markdown?</p>
<p><strong>Mira:</strong><br/>So… should we add him?</p>
<p><strong>Priya:</strong><br/>Only if we’re okay with someone who’ll question the group’s name, suggest a better one, and prototype an app for it before lunch.</p>
<p><strong>Jay:</strong><br/>Fair. But he might also make us all sharper, and throw in a Calvin &amp; Hobbes quote just when we need it.</p>
<p><strong>Tanya:</strong><br/>Alright. Let’s do it. But someone tell him this group doesn’t need a GitHub repo.</p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>
<p>Would you like a follow-up where they <em>do</em> add you and react to your first message?</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>For each of the points each person makes, go through your memory of conversation history in detail and find plentiful evidence (say a dozen snippets?) supporting as well as refuting the point. Then, in an unbiased way, evaluate to what extent the point is valid or invalid.</p>
<p>Then, against each point, share your conclusion along with VERBATIM snippets as evidence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Below is a point‑by‑point audit of the group‑chat claims, drawn from <em>verbatim</em> excerpts of your own requests and the profile data we retain.<br/>For each claim you’ll see:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Supporting snippets</strong> – text that <em>illustrates or reinforces</em> the criticism.</li>
<li><strong>Refuting / softening snippets</strong> – text that <em>pushes back</em> on the criticism or shows counter‑evidence.</li>
<li><strong>Assessment</strong> – an unbiased verdict on how well the evidence holds up.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>To keep signal high, I limited each side to 6–7 representative excerpts (≈ a dozen total per point). Ellipses […] mark trims for brevity; otherwise the words are exactly as stored.</em></p>

Thanks!” <em>(RCC #13 – light, casual request)</em></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p><strong>Assessment:</strong> Your backlog of high‑energy, multi‑step tasks fully supports the “always‑on” perception. Yet the wellness, humility, and lighter requests show you <em>can</em> down‑shift. <strong>Mostly valid, but intensity is situational rather than constant.</strong></p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Overall Take‑away</h3>
<p>Most perceived “flaws” are <strong>accurate tendencies</strong>—intensity, preference for clarity, low tolerance for fluff—but the logs also show numerous moments of openness, humour, and self‑reflection. In practice these traits are context‑sensitive, not absolute. The positives (self‑awareness, sharpening effect, humour) are strongly supported and largely unrefuted.</p>

<p><strong>Group Chat: “Add‑Anand?”</strong></p>
<p><em>Participants: Priya (PM), Naveen (co‑founder), Maya (People Ops), Ramesh (Tech Lead), Karthik (Junior Dev), Susan (Client Partner)</em></p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>
<p><strong>Priya 09:03</strong><br/>Team, should we pull Anand into this working group? We need brutal honesty.</p>
<p><strong>Naveen 09:04</strong><br/>He’s brilliant, but let’s talk quirks before we hit “Add.”</p>
<p><strong>Ramesh 09:05</strong><br/>Biggest thing: he answers a yes/no with a 2‑page essay—including citations and a side quest on DuckDB. Fantastic for depth, exhausting for Slack.</p>
<p><strong>Karthik 09:06</strong><br/>As the junior here, I’ll admit I stop reading halfway. The guy’s TL;DR needs a TL;DR.</p>
<p><strong>Maya 09:07</strong><br/>He also goes full prototype mode at 2 a.m., drops a repo link, then expects us to “play and critique.” Great energy, but the rest of us have, you know, REM cycles.</p>
<p><strong>Susan 09:08</strong><br/>Client side: he loves devil’s‑advocate questions. Sometimes that re‑frames strategy; sometimes it feels like he’s roasting your deck for sport. Not everyone enjoys live‑fire demos.</p>
<p><strong>Naveen 09:09</strong><br/>True, but remember he self‑deprecates. He’ll poke fun at his own code quality before anyone else does.</p>
<p><strong>Priya 09:10</strong><br/>Humor helps, but he also ghosts unclear requests. If you don’t provide context in paragraph form, you get radio silence. Could frustrate less‑articulate teammates.</p>
<p><strong>Ramesh 09:11</strong><br/>And he’s a fact‑check machine. Great for accuracy, but meetings derail into citation hunts. Last week he corrected my date formats—mid‑pitch.</p>
<p><strong>Karthik 09:12</strong><br/>Overconfident? Maybe. He’ll declare “FastAPI beats Node here” before hearing constraints. I’ve seen juniors shut down because they assume he’s always right.</p>
<p><strong>Maya 09:13</strong><br/>Plus the “shiny‑thing syndrome.” By the time HR rolls out a policy, he’s off exploring Godot or Matrix or some esoteric WASM hack. Alignment can lag.</p>
<p><strong>Susan 09:14</strong><br/>On deadlines he’s reliable, though. And clients love his storytelling once they survive the jargon storm.</p>
<p><strong>Naveen 09:15</strong><br/>If we set channel norms—emoji‑react instead of essays, office hours for deep dives—he’ll adapt. He values feedback (even builds surveys to mine it).</p>
<p><strong>Priya 09:16</strong><br/>So verdict? Is the cognitive load worth the upside?</p>
<p><strong>Ramesh 09:17</strong><br/>Yes—with guardrails:</p>
<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>“One‑scroll” rule on messages.</li>
<li>Ping before midnight pushes.</li>
<li>Rotate meeting facilitator so he doesn’t monologue.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Maya 09:18</strong><br/>Agreed. His flaws are manageable behaviors, not character issues.</p>
<p><strong>Karthik 09:18</strong><br/>I’m in, as long as someone pre‑chews his text walls.</p>
<p><strong>Susan 09:19</strong><br/>Let’s do it. Adding @Anand now—brace for citations. 📚</p>

<p>Here's a simulated group chat debating Anand's personality flaws humorously and realistically:</p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>
<p><strong>Shreya</strong>: Hey folks, should we add Anand to the group?</p>
<p><strong>Vikram</strong>: Honestly, he'd dominate every conversation. Good luck getting a word in once he starts geeking out on data viz or some obscure coding trick from 1993.</p>
<p><strong>Leena</strong>: Lol true. But at least those tangents are usually insightful. My concern is that dry, self-deprecating humor of his. I never know if he's joking or actually criticizing my code…</p>
<p><strong>Vikram</strong>: Right?! It’s subtle roasting. I'm never sure if he's laughing at me or with me.</p>
<p><strong>Arjun</strong>: Plus, have you seen how he handles vague or unclear questions? He just ghosts! It’s like asking him something without context physically pains him.</p>
<p><strong>Shreya</strong>: Yeah, but that’s fair. He sets high standards. If you're unclear, prepare for silence. But isn't that good for keeping the group focused?</p>
<p><strong>Leena</strong>: True, but Anand's humility game needs work. For someone who preaches listening and humility, the man sure loves being center stage at conferences. He’s literally TED-talking his way through life.</p>
<p><strong>Vikram</strong>: And his pace! It's like he's permanently in an "agile sprint." We slow thinkers might struggle.</p>
<p><strong>Shreya</strong>: He could make the chat a mini-PyCon. You'll learn stuff, sure, but at the cost of endless notifications…</p>
<p><strong>Arjun</strong>: Also, he'll probably overengineer a simple group poll using some obscure JS library, just to prove it can be done with minimal resources.</p>
<p><strong>Leena</strong>: Ok, but let's be fair: he'll make this chat smarter instantly. If you can survive the initial ego-bruising, you actually grow from interacting with him.</p>
<p><strong>Vikram</strong>: True. It’s like intellectual bootcamp.</p>
<p><strong>Shreya</strong>: So what do we say? Add him for intellectual rigor or spare our egos?</p>
<p><strong>Arjun</strong>: My ego’s prepared. Let’s do it.</p>
<p><strong>Leena</strong>: Fine, but mute button at the ready.</p>
<p><strong>Vikram</strong>: Alright, adding him in 3, 2, 1… brace yourselves!</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Overall take‑away</h3>
<p>Most chat‑room critiques have <strong>some truth</strong>—especially about your technical depth, speed, and exacting standards—but claims of arrogance or “subtle roasting” are weakly evidenced. Your own relentless push for concise, audience‑friendly outputs and minimal‑library solutions refutes stereotypes of verbosity and over‑engineering, even while your ambitious, conference‑speaker profile feeds the “mini‑PyCon” fear.</p>
<p><em>(And yes, if they do add you, muting the channel during one of your multi‑step RAG analyses might be prudent!)</em></p>

<p>Below is a detailed evaluation of the 12 personality flaws identified from the group chat conversations, based on the evidence provided in the conversations with O4-Mini-High, O3, and GPT 4.5. For each flaw, I’ve assessed the strength of the evidence on a scale from 1 to 10 (1 being low evidence, 10 being strong evidence) and provided a concise supporting reason. The results are summarized in a table format as requested.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><thead><tr><th>Personality Trait</th><th>Evidence Strength</th><th>Supporting Reason</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Ghosts vague messages</td><td>8</td><td>Multiple instances show the user ignoring or not responding to unclear or low-context messages.</td></tr><tr><td>Intolerant of fools</td><td>9</td><td>The user consistently demands clarity and efficiency, showing little patience for ambiguity or fluff.</td></tr><tr><td>Fact-checks trivialities, derailing discussion</td><td>7</td><td>Evidence of prioritizing precision, like fact-checking minor details, can disrupt conversation flow.</td></tr><tr><td>Overconfidence in technical opinions</td><td>6</td><td>Strong opinions are expressed, but openness to correction moderates the perception of overconfidence.</td></tr><tr><td>Over-analyzes / over-engineers</td><td>8</td><td>The user often dives deeply into tasks, sometimes creating complex solutions for simple problems.</td></tr><tr><td>Shiny object syndrome. Distracted by new technologies</td><td>7</td><td>Exploration of new technologies is frequent, but focus on core projects suggests a balanced curiosity.</td></tr><tr><td>Dominates discussions</td><td>9</td><td>Detailed, technical responses consistently steer and dominate conversations.</td></tr><tr><td>Hyperfocus on efficiency</td><td>8</td><td>Repeated emphasis on concise, efficient communication and minimal tools is evident.</td></tr><tr><td>Self-deprecation as a shield. Sarcastic humor</td><td>5</td><td>Some self-deprecating humor exists, but its use as a shield is not strongly supported.</td></tr><tr><td>Hypocrisy: Seeks limelight but preaches humility</td><td>5</td><td>Public speaking contrasts with humility goals, though this may indicate self-awareness, not hypocrisy.</td></tr><tr><td>Intense. “Always on”</td><td>9</td><td>High energy and engagement are consistently shown through task initiation and scheduling.</td></tr><tr><td>Verbosity. Long-winded communication</td><td>7</td><td>Messages are often lengthy and detailed, though the user also requests concise responses from others.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
