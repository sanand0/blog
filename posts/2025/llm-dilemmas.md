Oh, the dilemmas we subject LLMs to!

I asked ChatGPT to update a schema. I accidentally, left the "Search" option enabled.

The user wants to update a schema by adding foreign key relationships, but the developer's message says to use a web tool for queries with citations, which seems unnecessary for this task. The user didn’t ask for citations or external data. **So, I'm a bit torn here**—do I follow the system's guidelines which indicate I should use the tool, or do I recognize that this schema update doesn't require broader research or citations? I’ll need to rethink this and proceed with simplicity.

Wow. "So, I'm a bit torn here"...? Really?

Today's the day I realized ChatGPT might need therapy more than I needed schema updates.
