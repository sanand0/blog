At first glance, GPT 4.5 didn’t impress me. Claude 3.7 Sonnet did. I also didn’t like Gemini 2.5 Pro, but Grok was great.

```text
Grok 3 > Claude 3.7 Sonnet > Gemini 2.5 Pro > GPT 4.5.
```

But it’s hard to compare a dozen quotes at once. So I made a small [quotes arena app](https://tools.s-anand.net/quotesarena/) to help me pick my favorites. It shows me random pairs of quotes and asks which I like more.

To my surprise, after answering 30+ "games" in the arena, I found that based on my preferences:

```text
Claude 3.7 Sonnet > Gemini 2.5 Pro > GPT 4.5 > Grok 3.
```

That was weird. I thought I liked Grok's results a lot. I continued till I answered 50+ games. Then I found that:

```text
Grok 3 > GPT 4.5 > Gemini 2.5 Pro > Claude 3.7 Sonnet.
```

That's the **exact** opposite of the previous result.

Honestly, I'm depressed. I've learnt 3 things:

1. I can't judge stuff at a glance.
2. But I think I can (especially with code.)
3. Even when evaluating carefully, my preferences are unstable.

**Nothing** has shaken my confidence more in recent times. I **cannot** trust my judgement. I need written evals. Badly.
