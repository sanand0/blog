Here's a comic book analyzing my Google Search History.

It's a simpler version of [my earlier post](/blog/my-top-chatgpt-chat-categories/). I created it using PicBook, a tool I vibe-coded over ~5 hours.

- PicBook: https://tools.s-anand.net/picbook/
- Code: https://github.com/sanand0/tools/tree/main/picbook
- Codex chat: https://chatgpt.com/s/cd_6886699abfb08191acf036f6185781be

The code prompt begins with _Implement a_ /_picbook tool to create a sequence of visually consistent images from multiline captions using the_ `gpt`-`image`-𝟭 _OpenAI model_ and continues for 6 chats totaling ~22 min. My review took 4.5 hours. Clearly I need to optimize reviews.

Once generated, I drafted the storyline:

- I analyzed 4 years of my Google search history. [Draw: Night study room. Protagonist unrolls a dusty scroll from a trunk labeled “BACKUPS”. Ghostly numbers and topic names swirl out. Candlelight + laptop glow mix.]
- It's mostly tech. That was no surprise. [Draw: Protagonist bored, leaning on a pile of hefty tomes: “JS DOM (1613)”, “Python Tools (1402)”. He’s sipping chai, half-asleep. A speech bubble with “meh”.]
- ...

Full storyline: https://sanand0.github.io/datastories/google-searches/#comic-story

... and about 11 minutes later, the story was generated. I just needed to print as PDF.

Now that it's easier, more people might create comics. (But perhaps not on LinkedIn. Business networkers seem uncomfortable around comics.)
