I was testing LLMs' sense of Tamil humor with this quote:

> Extend this post with more funny Tamil words that end with .ai - mentioning why they're funny.
>
> Chenn.ai is the artificial intelligence capital of India.\
> Kadal.ai\
> Kad.ai\
> Dos.ai\
> Vad.ai\
> Ad.ai\
> Thal.ai\
> Mallig.ai\
> Aratt.ai\
> And finally\
> Podad.ai\
> All spoken in namma bash.ai 😅

The Chinese models didn't fare well.
