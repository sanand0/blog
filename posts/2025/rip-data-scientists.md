Slides for my DataHack Summit talk (controversially) titled **RIP Data Scientists** are at https://sanand0.github.io/talks/2025-08-21-rip-data-scientists/

**Summary**: as data scientists we explore, clean, model, explain, deploy, and anonymize datasets. I live-vibe-coded _each_ step with DGCA data in 35 minutes using ChatGPT.

Of course, it's the _tasks_ that are dying, not the role. Data scientists will leverage AI, differentiate on other skills, and move on.

But the highlight was an audience comment: "I'm no data scientist. I'm a domain person. I'll tell you all this: If you don't follow these practices, you won't have a job with me!"

They're catching on! 🙂
