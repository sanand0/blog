I tried out GPT Image 1.5. It adds more contrast, ink, texture, detail, and polish. See https://sanand0.github.io/llmartstyle/?category=pop

It's more powerful when generating different infographic styles: https://sanand0.github.io/llmartstyle/?category=text

But it's still terrible at faces. Overall, better competition for Nano Banana. Not yet dethroning Nano Banana Pro for me.
