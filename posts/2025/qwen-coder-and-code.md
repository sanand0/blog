Alibaba released an open-source coding model (qwen-coder) and tool (qwen-code).

- qwen-code + qwen-coder cost 8 cents and made 3 mistakes. https://lnkd.in/gguSGdv6
- qwen-code + claude-sonnet-4 cost 104 cents and made no mistakes. https://lnkd.in/gEPnVS-F
- claude-code cost 29 cents and made no mistakes. https://lnkd.in/gyCVeAr4

There's no reason to shift yet, but it's a good step in the development of open code models & tools.
