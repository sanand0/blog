While meditating, I realized 75% of "LULL" is the letter "L". (This sort of thing happens a lot when I meditate.)

MUMMY (60% M) and DADDY (60% D) have lower percentage, but are longer, so maybe get a bonus?

I asked Claude Code what would top such a list. It picked a dictionary, generated the 333 words with 4+ letters and >50% concentration.

What did I like best? "ASSESSES". 5/8 letters are "S". That's nearly two-thirds.

Then **it wrote an xkcd-style story**! Here are snippets:

> I wrote a Python script to analyze 370,105 English words. Then I questioned my life choices.

> *Does "mmmm" count? Look, I didn't make the dictionary. I just downloaded it from the internet.

> Notice something? After length 6, it's just S-words and E-words all the way down. (It's the grammatical duct tape of English)

> I didn't analyze Welsh, but I'm guessing their L's would be extremely competitive.

The story _way more fun_ than the analysis!
