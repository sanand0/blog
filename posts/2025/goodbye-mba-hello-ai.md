At the DoMS, IIT Madras 2025 commencement, I shared how MBA students might adapt to an AI world.

Takeaways

- The MBA syllabus will age fast; adaptability is a core competency https://youtu.be/sSyBUSuLduQ?t=02m03s
- LLMs have a “jagged-edge”. Management tools—redundancy, cross-checks, human escalation—still work https://youtu.be/sSyBUSuLduQ?t=07m02s
- LLMs already deliver hours of analyst work in minutes. Entry-level roles WILL vanish https://youtu.be/sSyBUSuLduQ?t=14m21s
- High-value knowledge jobs—strategy, finance, contract risk, market research—are being refactored by AI https://youtu.be/sSyBUSuLduQ?t=23m01s
- Learn less of grunt-work. LLMs can handle that https://youtu.be/sSyBUSuLduQ?t=45m22s
- Study with LLMs as Socratic sparring. Run “draft-critique-rewrite” sprints https://youtu.be/sSyBUSuLduQ?t=49m17s

Funny bits

- “It’s awkward when you don’t know whether to clap… I'll give you a signal right at the end.” https://youtu.be/sSyBUSuLduQ?t=01m08s
- Grok-4: “Apparently it basically repeats whatever Elon Musk says.” https://youtu.be/sSyBUSuLduQ?t=12m22s
- To the lone student without a phone: “I love you… the rest of you, scan the QR code.” https://youtu.be/sSyBUSuLduQ?t=20m02s
- “At least for the next few years, use AI. Don't talk about AI.” https://youtu.be/sSyBUSuLduQ?t=39m09s
- “Please sleep. Tell the LLM to do the assignments… This is going on record, but I’m not faculty, so I can say what I want.” https://youtu.be/sSyBUSuLduQ?t=49m52s
