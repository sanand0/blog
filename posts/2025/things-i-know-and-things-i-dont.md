![Things I know and things I don't](/blog/assets/image-3.webp)

We all have stuff we know well and don't. I know the % charge on my phone to within a few percent and the current time to within a few minutes -- no matter when you ask. But I have no idea how much money there is in my pocket.

| Things I know within 5% error | Things I get wrong by ~500%       |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Current time                  | Time to finish my current task    |
| My weight                     | My next meal                      |
| % charge on my phone          | How long the phone will last      |
| Number of unread emails       | Time to clear them                |
| Price of my next earphones    | Cash in my wallet                 |
| Length of this list           | How long it will go before I stop |

But this apart, it turns out generating [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/) style comic strips is harder than I thought.
