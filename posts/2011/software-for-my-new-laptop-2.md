Time for a new [laptop](http://us.toshiba.com/computers/laptops/portege/r700/), and to [replace software](/blog/software-for-my-new-laptop/). Here’s my new list.

A lot has changed in the last 5 years. Mainly, I use the [browser](http://chrome.google.com/), [cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) and [Portable Apps](http://portableapps.com/) a **lot** more. (The last is to escape [jailers](/blog/you-are-in-prison/), not [registry bloat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registry_cleaner#Metrics_of_performance_benefit).)

**Media**

- [Chrome](http://chrome.google.com/) [new]: For browsing **and** development. Fast, light, and stays out of the way.
- [Firefox](http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/firefox_portable): I keep it just for printing. [Chrome sucks at printing](http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?tid=17a4ac343580c8d3&hl=en).
- [Media Player Classic](http://www.free-codecs.com/download/k_lite_codec_pack.htm): Nothing against it, but I decided to stick to just one app, which is…
- [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/): Continues to be the best media player, IMHO.
- [WinAmp](http://www.winamp.com/): I just manage my playlists as M3U files, using Python programs.
- [Audacity](http://portableapps.com/apps/music_video/audacity_portable): Still the easiest way to record audio.
- [Camstudio](http://portableapps.com/apps/utilities/camstudio_portable): The simplest free portable screen capture software I know.
- [PicPick](http://www.picpick.org/) [new]: Lightweight, powerful screenshot grabber
- [VirtualDub](http://portableapps.com/apps/music_video/virtualdub_portable): Not the simplest, but still good for what I need: cropping and joining video.
- [MediaCoder](http://www.mediacoderhq.com/) [new]: Good for video/audio conversions. Maybe I’ll install this later.
- [Foxit Reader](http://portableapps.com/apps/office/foxit_reader_portable): The simples free portable PDF reader I know, better than…
- [NitroPDF Reader](http://www.nitropdf.com/) [new]: … which is good for Printing PDFs – better than…
- [Primo PDF](http://www.primopdf.com/): … which has trouble on rare occasions.
- [Microsoft Reader](http://www.microsoft.com/reader/): I have a lot of ebooks in .LIT.
- [Kindle for PC](http://www.amazon.com/gp/kindle/pc) [new]: I don’t own a Kindle, but I’ve bought a few ebooks.
- [Paint.NET](http://www.getpaint.net/): Good enough for cropping and adjusting colours on images.
- [Windows Live Writer](http://explore.live.com/windows-live-writer) [new]: The best way to write this blog [WYSIWYG](/blog/wordpress-themes-on-windows-live-writer/)
- [Inkscape](http://portableapps.com/apps/graphics_pictures/inkscape_portable) [new]: I occasionally [edit vector graphics](/blog/india-district-map/).
- [Google Earth](http://earth.google.com/). Google Maps is good enough.
- [ImgBurn](http://www.imgburn.com/): I no longer use CDs/DVDs. Just flash drives and external hard disks.
- [Picasa](http://picasa.google.com/): I’ve stopped browsing pictures. No time.

**Sharing**

- [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com/) [new]: Simplest way of sharing files.
- [Skype](http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/skype_portable): I use it more than my phone.
- [Google Talk](http://www.google.com/talk/): For those friends who have chat enabled on Gmail.
- [TeamViewer](http://portableapps.com/apps/utilities/teamviewer_portable) [new]: Pretty efficient screen sharing. Works better than Skype, I think.
- [Google Calendar Sync](http://www.google.com/sync/pc.html): To keep Outlook in sync with Google Calendar.

**Utilities**

- [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) [new]: Covers all compressed formats, and has the best compression ratio.
- [WinRAR](http://www.rarlab.com/): 7-Zip has it covered.
- [AutoHotKey](http://www.autohotkey.com/) [new]: Shockingly powerful macro functionality. Shockingly underused.

- [Teracopy](http://www.codesector.com/teracopy.php): I don’t worry too much about copying files any more. Maybe later.
- [Junction Link Magic](http://www.rekenwonder.com/linkmagic.htm) [new]: To map folders. But I now use Cygwin, and symlinks rock.

- [ActivePython](http://www.activestate.com/activepython/downloads): My primary programming language.

- [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) [new]: … is just a little bit **cooler**.
- [Crimson Editor](http://www.crimsoneditor.com/): [Didn’t have Unicode](/blog/in-search-of-a-good-editor/) support a long time ago, so I switched.

  I'm trialing Xplorer2.
- **[Arun](http://www.arunrocks.com)** _13 Oct 2011 6:11 pm_:
  I tried to do something similar and then got lazy and simply installed VirtualBox ;)
- **Rajasekar** _4 Nov 2011 11:35 am_:
  Good One.
- **bhavesh** _4 Jan 2012 5:24 pm_:
  What about CClener and Unlocker?

  Finally :-)
- **[Ravi Atluri (@sonnes)](http://www.raviatluri.in)** _28 Sep 2011 7:14 am_:
  One more thing, I wanted to know from you is - How do you organize your work, specifically code and how do you handle repository and workspaces (if you use an IDE) ?
  In case you don't use an IDE, what kind of coding environment?
  I got a new laptop a few months back and have been trying to figure out how to start organizing my work, repositories of things I work or experiment on and the IDE. Currently, I am trying to put in Java, Python and Scala into eclipse by using it's plugins, hoping eclipse would help me to organize the code and repos.
- **Mohit** _30 Sep 2011 8:37 am_:
  At least some of this could be automated :)
  check out "ninite dot com"
- **Shankar V** _30 Sep 2011 3:06 pm_:
  Excellent list. Thanks for sharing :)
  I agree about Eclipse - too heavy. But if you code in Java, I dont see a better alternative. Anyone remember NetBeans?
  Google Desktop - I find this amazingly useful and I am sad Google is retiring this. Wish there is a good alternative. I hate windows search.
- **Venu** _7 Oct 2011 7:22 am_:
  Thanks for excellent compilation.
  Can you point to any free utility to optimize the performance of our computers
- **TD** _28 Sep 2011 8:32 am_:
  Wordweb and Evernote
- **TD** _28 Sep 2011 8:38 am_:
  Also, iTunes.... Not that I like it but for Ipod.
- **[S Anand](http://www.s-anand.net/)** _28 Sep 2011 3:13 pm_:
  @Ravi: I don't use an IDE. Just Sublime Text + bash/Command Prompt + git/hg. Since I don't use Java, I can stay away from Eclipse (which I think is way too heavy for my liking).
- **[Karen](http://www.registrycleanersreviewed.com/)** _17 May 2012 5:23 am_:
  Very nice list! I would add JV 16 Power Tools to the Utilities list. They have a free 30 day fully functional trial to try them out. It's not limited like most trial software.
- **Vinu** _11 Aug 2012 11:06 am_:
  If you spend any time in Excel, ASAP Utilities is an absolute joy!... get it and I'm pretty sure, you'll swear by it in no time..
  the Sparklines add-in by Fabrice Rimlinger is also excellent.. a bit raw, but powerful nevertheless.
- **[Vinayak](http://learningconcepts.in/)** _23 Jan 2013 7:40 am_:
  Nice list. You should really try out:
  Xplorer2 (get the professional version if you can - it is $30 and worth every penny and more) from http://zabkat.com
  Wikidpad - for organizing information in an offline desktop wiki - from http://wikidpad.sourceforge.net/
