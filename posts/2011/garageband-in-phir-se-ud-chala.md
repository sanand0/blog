<p>A month ago, I was at the <a href="http://www.myvue.com/home/cinema/stratford">theatre</a> watching <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra.One">Ra.One</a>. The movie was <a href="http://www.thevigilidiot.com/2011/10/28/ra-one/">terrible</a>, yet enjoyable. But I’m going to talk about something else – a song I heard that caught my imagination.</p> <p><iframe height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/kkCs6GiSG0k" frameborder="0" width="560" allowfullscreen></iframe></p> <p>The song is Phir Se Ud Chala from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockstar_(2011_film)">Rockstar</a>. Around 14 seconds into the video, you’ll hear a guitar start off at the background. That’s what caught my ear first – because I’d heard it before. Listen to this piece below:</p> <p><a href="http://www.s-anand.net/mystic-light.mp3">Mystic light</a></p> <p>I’d created this a couple of months ago with <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/">GarageBand</a> on my iPad2. It just plays two Apple Loops one after another.</p> <p><a href="/blog/assets/photo.webp"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="photo" border="0" alt="photo" src="/blog/assets/photo.webp" width="600" height="450"></a></p> <p>The first one that you hear – Cheerful Mandolin 07 – is exactly the same background music that you hear in Phir Se Ud Chala. Guess A R Rahman uses GarageBand too!</p> <p>(The strange thing is, I found no mention of this anywhere on the internet, as of 2 Dec 2011. Thought I’d have a go and be the first… just in case someone searches for Apple Loops or GarageBand in Phir Se Ud Chala from Rockstar.)</p><script src="http://mediaplayer.yahoo.com/js"></script>

  The second loop is from Shauk Hai (Guru). Is this an Apple loop too?
- **Dinakaran** _3 Dec 2011 4:21 pm_:
  It could be that GarageBand came out as a product out of Logic Pro that ARR is using with similar sounds ?

  @Viju -- you're right! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1vAu0c96yY#t=152s
