  Thanks a lot for the tips! I think there might be a small error in the video posted above, since the last part about conditional formatting is repeated twice. Very useful nonetheless!

  Hey (stud) Anand , stumbled upon your blog recently. It is a great read.
  Lou Reed said "between thought and expression, lies a lifetime". I think you bridge that gap really well.
  You can add me to your list of avid followers now. :)
  I would especially recommend your blog to anyone who wants to get into the field of business analytics (all my students :) )
