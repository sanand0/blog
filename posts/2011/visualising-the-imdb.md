The [IMDb Top 250](http://www.imdb.com/chart/top), as a source of movies, dries out quickly. In my case, I’ve [seen about 175/250](http://250.s-anand.net/user/root.node@gmail.com). Not sure how much I want to see the rest.

When chatting with [Col Needham](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Col_Needham) (who’s working his way through every movie with over 40,000 votes), I came up with this as a useful way of finding what movies to watch next.

[![visualising-the-imdb-1](/blog/assets/visualisingtheimdb1.webp "visualising-the-imdb-1")](/blog/assets/visualisingtheimdb1.webp)

Each box is one or more movies. Darker boxes mean more movies. Those on the right have more votes.  Those on top have a better rating. The ones I’ve seen are green, the rest are red. (I’ve seen more movies than that – just haven’t marked them green yet :-)

I think people like to watch the movies on the top right – that popularity compensates (at least partly) for rating, and the number of votes is an indication of popularity.

For example, [my movie pattern](http://250.s-anand.net/visual/root.node@gmail.com) tells me that I ought to see [Cidade de Deus](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317248/), [Inglourious Basterds](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361748/) and [Heat](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113277/) – which I knew from the [IMDb Top 250](http://250.s-anand.net/user/root.node@gmail.com), but also that I ought to cover [Kick-Ass](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1250777/), [The Hangover](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1119646/) and [Juno](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0467406/).

[![visualising-the-imdb-2](/blog/assets/visualisingtheimdb2.webp "visualising-the-imdb-2")](/blog/assets/visualisingtheimdb2.webp)

It’s easy to pick movies in a specific genre as well.

[![visualising-the-imdb-3](/blog/assets/visualisingtheimdb3.webp "visualising-the-imdb-3")](/blog/assets/visualisingtheimdb3.webp)

Clearly, there are many more Comedy movies in the list than any other type – though Romance and Action are doing fine too. And I seem the have a strong preference for the Fantasy genre, in stark contrast to Horror.

(Incidentally, I’ve given up trying to see [The Shining](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081505/) after three attempts. [Stephen King](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_King)’s scary enough. The [novel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shining_(novel)) kept me awake checking under my bed for a week at night. Then there’s [Stanley Kubrick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_kubrick)’s style. [A Clockwork Orange](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066921/) was disturbing enough, but [Haley Joel Osment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haley_Joel_Osment) in the first part of [A.I.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0212720/) was downright scary. Finally, there’s [Jack Nicholson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_nicholson). Sorry, but I won’t risk that combination on a bright sunny day with the doors open.)

You can track your list at <http://250.s-anand.net/visual>.

For those who want to play with the code, it’s at <http://code.google.com/p/two-fifty/source/browse/trunk/visual.html>.
