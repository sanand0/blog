4:00pm. Just started watching The Social Network. I'm fairly sure I won't like the film, mostly because I'll be jealous of Mark.

About 5 minutes into the movie. I find myself rewinding to catch the dialogues. They're very fast. Very, very fast.

10 minutes. I like the code. I stopped on a screen to start checking if it's real code. It's in Perl. Stopped myself before I started dry-running the code.

20 minutes. OK, some of this is a bit beyond me. But good movie.

1:20. Dropped a note to Ram asking (almost forcing) him to watch the film. A fair bit to learn from a stakeholding perspective.

1:45. Dammit. I see a bit of the anti-social me in him.

Gripping. Overall, bloody good movie. Quite surprised. And no, definitely not feeling jealous.
