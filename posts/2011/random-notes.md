The whole point of a blog is to be able to write what I want, isn't it? Without the need to be coherent. Intelligent. Useful.

I read somewhere, in a top 10 list of advice to programmers -- to avoid constipation. It's actually good advice. It gives you a headache for the rest of the day. That piece of code is really not worth it, trust me.

But then, when you have a headache, there isn't anything quite as beautiful and relaxing as code. Or good documentation. Like node.js docs, for example.

Just finished seeing Casino Royale. Usual average movie. 3,3,1.

I hate that git doesn't work. I hate that my mobile broadband dongle doesn't work. I hate that I have too much to do.

I love beautiful typography. line-height:1.5 and a nice Georgia to go with it. (Yeah, Ram had this one right: madness is not a result of being in GramEner. It's a pre-requisite.)

Well, dinner's ready.
