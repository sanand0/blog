The University of Virginia computes the [Bacon Number](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/oracle/) for any actor, similar to the [Erdos number](http://www.oakland.edu/~grossman/erdoshp.html) in mathematics. We trace the acting links of [Shahrukh Khan](http://oracleofbacon.org/cgi-bin/oracle/movielinks?firstname=Bacon%2c+Kevin&game=1&secondname=Khan%2c+Shahrukh&using=1), [Amitabh Bachchan](http://oracleofbacon.org/cgi-bin/oracle/movielinks?firstname=Bacon%2C+Kevin&game=1&secondname=Amitabh+Bachchan), and even [Prabhu Deva](http://oracleofbacon.org/cgi-bin/oracle/movielinks?firstname=Bacon%2C+Kevin&game=1&secondname=Prabhu+Deva) to Kevin Bacon. (BCG did the same for consultants who have worked together, and it turns out that I have a [Bruce Henderson](http://www.bcg.com/this_is_bcg/bcg_history.asp) number of 3.)
