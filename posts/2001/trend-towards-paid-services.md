Now Yahoo! will [charge a fee for auctions](http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20010103/ts/tech_yahoo_dc_1.html). No more free PCs. No more free ISPs. No more ad revenues. No more free auctions. The trend is clear. Pay! Unfortunately, they'll also monitor what's being sold -- an indication that country-specific legal barriers are creeping into the Internet.
