[Changemakers.net](http://www.changemakers.net/) is a journal/portal for social entrepreneurship. That is, people who're changing society in a new way. Normally, I wouldn't have given this a second thought, but the site appears so extensive, and the concept so intruiging, that I think it's worth a browse. [DigitalDivide.org](http://www.digitaldivide.org/) is based on a similar theme, except for the Internet world.
