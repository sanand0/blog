Spielberg's next movie, [A.I.](http://aimovie.warnerbros.com/), has sparked a weird game. I read the [article on it at ZDNet](http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2713561,00.html) and searched for Jeanine Salla, listed as the movie's sentient machine therapist, which lead me to [her site](http://www.bangaloreworldu-in.co.nz/salla/default.html), (at the so called "Bangalore World University"!!) and from there to others... it really is a wierd game. Those with enthu, do try it and let me know your progress.
