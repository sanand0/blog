A chat with Business Consulting on chat.rediff.com as anand\_m26blr. Right through this conversation, Business Consulting keeps pumping in news about the world to everyone.\
**anand\_m26blr**: Hi! How come you call yourself Business Consulting?\
**business\_consulting**: Why no\*\*\*\*\* just another name\
**anand\_m26blr**: Fair enough. ASL?\

**anand\_m26blr**: I'm studying at IIM-B. And you?\
**business\_consulting**: IIM-B? which year?\
**anand\_m26blr**: Second. What about you?\
**business\_consulting**: Hey do you have any news from IIM-A? like how's the scene at the campus and are they ok?\
**anand\_m26blr**: Sure. One of our profs gets regular updates on IIM-A. Only one person is hurt, and no one badly. One dorm (D, I think) is pretty much wiped out. Otherwise, things are fine. Want me to mail you the updates?\
**business\_consulting**: 2nd year..Finance-Marketing or Systems?\
**anand\_m26blr**: None. I just picked the courses that looked good. Come on, you're asking all the questions. What about you?\
**business\_consulting**: Sure mail me\
**anand\_m26blr**: What's your e-mail ID?\
**business\_consulting**: Basically in to systems-ERP. I work on Peoplesoft.\
**anand\_m26blr**: Neat! I used to work at IBM myself. Never worked on Peoplesoft products, though, but we were planning to integrate it with Lotus Notes at one point. How long have you been here?\
**business\_consulting**: ok.. u can mail me at hschandra@ftnetwork.com\
**anand\_m26blr**: Mailing you...\
**business\_consulting**: Here? are u in London too?\
**anand\_m26blr**: I didn't know you were in London. No, I'm in Bangalore right now. I was in London a month ago at LBS on an exchange programme. How come you're in London?\
**business\_consulting**: IBM That's\
**business\_consulting**: Wow that's great LBS @ CanaryWarf\
**anand\_m26blr**: No this is London Business School -- near Lord's.\
**business\_consulting**: IBM that's good. My Bangalore friend is doing his PG at IIM-A. After hearing aboutthe earthquake Imailed him and so far no news from him.\
**business\_consulting**: So are you specializing in finance?\
**anand\_m26blr**: Nope. I'm interested in technology still. So looking at any IT consulting firms that are coming along. Where did you study?\
**business\_consulting**: I did all my education inBangalore. Are u from Bangalorean as well?\
**business\_consulting**: Sorry, from Banglaore not Banglorean!!\
**anand\_m26blr**: I'm from Madras, basically. Studied there right through. You might know some of my classmates, though. When did you finish your undergrad? Was it from BMS?\
**business\_consulting**: It was way back in 95 mate. Long time 6 years now.. Just thinking of CFA as well..\
**anand\_m26blr**: Not all that way back. I passed out in 1996 myself. Where from?\
**business\_consulting**: So youwere @IBM Bangalore or somewhere else? IIM-Btied up with SAP long ago I think\
**anand\_m26blr**: I was at Bangalore most of the time. Yeah, IBM tied up with SAP, but I was with the Lotus Notes division, and we were integrating will all the products around.\
**business\_consulting**: You can do that since its doing pretty well in the US right now. And later onu can shift to CRM too\
**anand\_m26blr**: That's probably the plan right now. So you've been working for Peoplesoft at London all along, is it?\
**business\_consulting**: Have you done the LN certification ?\
**anand\_m26blr**: Yeah, I'm a certified Notes instructor.\
**business\_consulting**: Currently , are u working @ IBM or studying PG @ IIMB??\
