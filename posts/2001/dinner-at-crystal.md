**Crystal** is opposite to Chowpatti beach. I didn't know that, so when Bhura suggested we take a cab there from Churchgate, I boldly said, "Let's walk down the beach." It's not that long a walk, but longer than I'm normally used to. At the end of the walk, I nearly collapsed. Crystal is apparantly pretty famous for its value-for-money. We ordered 2 alu parathas with **malai kofta** and **paneer masala** and dahi. The food was quite tasty, but filling. Neither of us had space for many more rotis. The bill came to about Rs. 100.
