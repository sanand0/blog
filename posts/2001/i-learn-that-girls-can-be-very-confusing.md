**anand\_m26blr**: Hi Sonisha! How're you?\
**sonisha\_jd**: hi\
**anand\_m26blr**: Where are you from?\
**sonisha\_jd**: adb\
**anand\_m26blr**: Sorry? ADB?\
**sonisha\_jd**: adilabad\
**sonisha\_jd**: a.p\
**anand\_m26blr**: Oh, I see. I'm right now in Mumbai.\
**anand\_m26blr**: Which chat room are you in?

The reason I asked this was because **sonisha\_jd** wasn't in the chat room I was in, and I was logged in invisibly. I have a theory on who **sonisha\_jd** is, but that's a different story.

**sonisha\_jd**: will u mail me?\
**sonisha\_jd**: yahoo\
**anand\_m26blr**: Sure... but mail you what? I didn't understand...\
**sonisha\_jd**: what?\
**anand\_m26blr**: You said "will you mail me?" -- I didn't get that part. You mean, keep in touch on e-mail? Or you want me to mail you right away?\
**sonisha\_jd**: u mail me\
**sonisha\_jd**: ok\
**anand\_m26blr**: OK, I'll mail you. **sonisha\_jd**@yahoo.com -- right?

By this time, I'm confused enough to agree to anything.

**sonisha\_jd**: ya\
**sonisha\_jd**: how u got it

That sounded like a condescending "How clever?" that I've heard before. Fuelled my suspicions on the identify of **sonisha\_jd**.

**anand\_m26blr**: How did I get what? Your e-mail ID? From your login...\
**anand\_m26blr**: Are you a student?\
**sonisha\_jd**: ya\
**sonisha\_jd**: u?\
**sonisha\_jd**: lazy bone!

Unprovoked and meaningless outburst. Again something I'm used to and have a theory about.

**anand\_m26blr**: What? Who's a lazy bone!?\
**sonisha\_jd**: ok bye mail me!\
**sonisha\_jd**: u\
**anand\_m26blr**: Hello?

Abrupt termination of conversation. Intruiging.
