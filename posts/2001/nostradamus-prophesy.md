There's been several mails about Nostradamus' prophecy coming true with the World Trade Center bombings. Stuff like

>> "In the City of God there will be a great thunder,\
>> Two brothers torn apart by Chaos, while the fortress\
>> endures, the great leader will succumb" , "The third\
>> big war will begin when the big city is burning"

I refer you to [this article](http://www.ed.brocku.ca/~nmarshal/nostradamus.htm) to put things in perspective.
