[Nomic](http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/nomic.htm) is a game that you play by changing the rules of the game. You start with an [initial set of rules](http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/nomic.htm) and then players can vote to change the rules. Steve Gardner has produced a [summary](ftp://ftp.cse.unsw.edu.au/pub/users/malcolmr/nomic/articles/summaries.txt) of many such games played on the Internet. If you're interested in legislation, or online games, this is an interesting topic.
