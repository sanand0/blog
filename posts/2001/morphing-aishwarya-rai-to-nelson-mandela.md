My friend [Manu](http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/~varghese) is doing research in graphics at Ohio State. You really must see his morphs: [Ash to Mandela](http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/~varghese/graphics/AshToNelson.html), for example. After playing around with the grid, I realised Mandala's pretty handsome too. Requires Java.
