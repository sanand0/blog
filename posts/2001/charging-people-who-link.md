The [Albuquerque Journal](http://www.abqjournal.com/) charges $50 if you [want to link](http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,40850,00.html) to their articles! A new revenue model? Legally its possible. I don't think too many sites can get away with it, though. I mean, only the [Wall Street Journal](http://www.wsj.com) gets away with charging for content. Anyway, looks like [flat rate pricing will eventually win](http://www.thestandard.com/article/display/0,1151,20976-0,00.html).
