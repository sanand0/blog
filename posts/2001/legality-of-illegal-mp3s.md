Sweden has [ruled](http://slashdot.org/yro/99/12/28/0814212.shtml) that it's OK to have links to illegal MP3s, so long as the server is in a country where illegal MP3s are legal. That's in stark contrast with [France vs Yahoo](http://www.zdnet.com/intweek/stories/news/0,4164,2656099,00.html). In fact, the norm is that linking even to the front page of commercial sites [needs permission](http://www.llrx.com/features/weblink1.htm) sometimes. A court in Utah [ruled](http://www.cnn.com/1999/TECH/computing/12/13/illegal.links.idg/) that providing links to copyrighted material could constitute copyright infringement. Better check out [cyberlaws](http://law.about.com/newsissues/law/msub34.htm?once=true&) and ensure compliance with [copyright rules on the Internet](http://www.fplc.edu/tfield/cOpyNet.htm).

Violation is often in the eye of the beholder. "Anyone who makes derogatory references to others (or their sites, products or services), however it is done, invites trouble."
