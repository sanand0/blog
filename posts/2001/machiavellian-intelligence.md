The [Machiavellian Intelligence](http://cognet.mit.edu/MITECS/Entry/whiten) hypothesis says that the brain evolved more for its social purpose, than for finding food and things like that. Incidentally, Google's collection on [evolution](http://directory.google.com/Top/Science/Biology/Evolution/) is as comprehensive as ever.
