Big Brother took a little longer than 1984, but by 2001, it has arrived. Even if you didn't upload an copyrighted file, your ISP can [shut you down](http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2001/08/23/pirate/index.html). Oh, they can [monitor](http://news.zdnet.co.uk/story/0,,t269-s2093559,00.html) what you're doing too -- literally, by [face](http://www.computerworld.com/storyba/0,4125,NAV47_STO63359,00.html). And imprison you [without trial](http://www.techtv.com/screensavers/showtell/story/0,23008,3343816,00.html). Better read up your "[copy rights](http://www.templetons.com/brad/copymyths.html)".
