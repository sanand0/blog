[Yahoo's auction listings fell 82%](http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/cn/20010210/tc/yahoo_auction_observers_see_dive_after_fees_start_1.html) when they started charging for auctions. But the sales apparantly is steady, and quality of listings is going up. Amazon may follow suit. Looks like the pay-model is the one that will survive on the Net.
