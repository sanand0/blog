Among all concepts I have encountered on the Web, this one is the most intruiging. [Ideosphere](http://www.ideosphere.com/) has created a futures market for ideas. You put a claim on this website, and people can buy/sell coupons based on these ideas. When the claim becomes true/false, these coupons increase/decrease in value. Of course, no real money is involved -- it's just a score. Very interesting, nevertheless, to get a feel of what people think. (There's a similar [exchange for Bollywood](http://www.bwsx.com/).)
