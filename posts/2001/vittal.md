Saurabh and I had **Pav Bhaji** and **Bhel Puri** at **Vittal**. The place was a pretty small outfit, like the Kamaths or the Sagars. But the dishes were among the best that I've ever had. Not expensive -- we finished at Rs. 75 between us, including an extra pav bun.

Then we watched **Miss Congeniality** at **New Excelsior**. The theatre didn't have a balcony, which is pretty surprising, but it appeared larger than Regal. The movie was produced by and stars Sandra Bullock as an FBI agent in a beauty pageant. Extremely funny, and without any message, thankfully.
