By the end of the year, Bangalore will become a [zero piracy zone](http://www.timesofindia.com/070601/07busi18.htm). First, the Karnataka Government will try and eliminate all piracy within. Then it'll appoint compliance officers who'll walk into offices and check randomly. And this will reduce piracy. Right. What of corruption?
