I shifted from Netscape Navigator to Internet Explorer because I could cut and paste tables from IE to Excel. But now that I've downloaded [Opera 5.11](http://www.opera.com), used its zoom function, it's gesture keys, and so on, I'm moving over to Opera. Long live Opera! (Which, given [Netscape's fate](http://biz.yahoo.com/rf/010606/n05260410_2.html), is perhaps no more than a fond hope.)
