The [US Bureau of Labor Statistics](http://stats.bls.gov/) has published a list of the [fastest growing occupations](http://stats.bls.gov/opub/ooq/2000/fall/oochart.pdf) from 1998-2008. The [Indian Labour Bureau](http://chd.nic.in/labour) publishes some useful [statistics](http://chd.nic.in/labour/schemes.html) too.
