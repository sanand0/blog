My site actually has pretty bad design against [these parameters](http://www.ignitiondesign.com/journal/public/). Need to work on it. Besides, the time is up for static sites. [Dynamic website design](http://acg.media.mit.edu/people/fry/thesis/) will rule. Wonder when Geocities will start offering these features.
