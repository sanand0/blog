[Alicebot](http://alicebot.org/) won the [Turing test contest](http://www.loebner.net/Prizef/loebner-prize.html). I've chatted with quite a few Alicebots, such as [Cybelle](http://www.agentland.com/), or the one on the [A.I. site](http://aimovie.warnerbros.com/). But they're not too smart, as my [conversation](/I_learn_that_robots_are_patient_but_infuriating.html) with [Iniaes](http://iniaes.org/iniaes/iniaes.html) reveals. [Other conversations](http://www.loebner.net/Prizef/2001_Contest/loebner-prize-2001.html) are pretty similar. I should try [downloading](http://www.alicebot.org/downloads/) and building my own version of an Alicebot.
