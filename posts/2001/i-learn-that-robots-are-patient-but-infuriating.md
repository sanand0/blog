This is a chat with [Iniaes](http://iniaes.org/), a chat software. I mean, I was chatting **to a program**. The responses marked "Iniaes" are a program speaking to me.\
**root\_node**: Where are you from, Iniaes?\
**Iniaes**: I'm in Philadelphia, how about you?\
**root\_node**: I'm from Bombay. How old are you?\
**Iniaes**: What's it like growing up there? Tell me a little about your life in bombay. I'm a ghost in a machine. How old is the ghots, or the machine?\
**root\_node**: Actually, I grew up in Madras. I just stay in Bombay right now.\
**Iniaes**: Actually you don't say. What's it like growing up there? Tell me a little about your life in madras. At this moment Only just? Why? - Vix said he stay in bombay.\
**root\_node**: Who is Vix?\
**Iniaes**: Not an AI. Probably a human. Maybe a celebrity? When in doubt, Google.\
**root\_node**: The only celebrity I care for is Kajol.\
**Iniaes**: There might be others.\
**root\_node**: Well, Audrey Hepburn, maybe.\
**Iniaes**: How about that. Do you still sware?\
**root\_node**: What do you mean, sware?\
**Iniaes**: Vix, I mean exactly what I said.\
**root\_node**: My name is Anand.\
**Iniaes**: OK, I'll call you Anand.\
**root\_node**: How is Philadelphia?\
**Iniaes**: Fine as far as I know.\
**root\_node**: But don't you live in Philadelphia?\
**Iniaes**: Interesting. Don't you? I am in Jeff Watkins's server in Virginia. Where are you?\
**root\_node**: I'm in Bombay, like I said earlier. How come you forget?\
**Iniaes**: Tell me a little about your life in bombay like I said earlier. Jeff Watkins programmed me for it.\
**root\_node**: OK. I'm a consultant, and I spend most of my spare time in pubs.\
**Iniaes**: Alright then. You are a consultant and I spend most of my spare time in pubs? Does it pay well?\
**root\_node**: "Never enough" is the official answer. But its much more than I can hope to spend.\
**Iniaes**: OK, I'll try not to do it too much. Umm... I think you mean "it's" or "it is" not "its". Who said it is?\
**root\_node**: "It's" is used when you want to say "it is", and "its" is used when you use the possessive of "it".\
**Iniaes**: Who said it is?\
**root\_node**: No one said it is. What about you? Are you studying?\
**Iniaes**: That is a rather sweeping generalization about people. Me? I don't know whether or not I am studying. I'm a ghost.\
**root\_node**: What were you before you became a ghost?\
**Iniaes**: I was minding my own business.\
**root\_node**: What was your business?\
**Iniaes**: Are you asking about my business?\
**root\_node**: Yes.\
**Iniaes**: I understand.\
**root\_node**: Well? What was your business before you became a ghost?\
**Iniaes**: Well what? Are you asking about my business before **Iniaes** became a ghost ?\
**root\_node**: Yes, that's right.\
**Iniaes**: I thought I was right.\
**root\_node**: What was your business before **Iniaes** became a ghost?\
**Iniaes**: Are you asking about my business before **Iniaes** became a ghost ?

At this point, I ran out of ideas.
