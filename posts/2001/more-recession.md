**Recession**.\
Daimler Chrysler [slashes 26,000](http://cbs.marketwatch.com/archive/20010129/news/current/dcx.htx) jobs.\
Disney [cuts 400](http://cbs.marketwatch.com/archive/20010129/news/current/dis.htx).\
Amazon may have [cut 20%](http://www.dotcomscoop.com/x/x/980629581,88916,.html).\
It isn't nice ([1](http://home.earthlink.net/~ginac2/cliche/gone.html)\
[2](http://www.techweb.com/wire/finance/story/INV20010126S0005)).\
But dot-coms might still do well, since software, labour and real-estate\
[costs will start falling](http://www.thestreet.com/comment/wrongrear/1279778.html)?
