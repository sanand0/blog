"Dude, Where's My Car" tops the list of [movies pirated on the Internet](http://www.mediaforce.com/news/prd.asp?pressrelease=476) in July. The pirating is usually through [file sharing](http://directory.google.com/Top/Computers/Software/Internet/Clients/File_Sharing/) software. Unlike music companies, [studios are moving with the wind](http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1005-200-6893344.html?tag=cd_mh), before it gets too late.
