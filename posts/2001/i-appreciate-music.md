I was scouring various chat rooms on Yahoo, when I hear music stream down one of the Mumbai chat rooms. It looked like fairly professional music. Quite nice. After a while, a message came on the the chat room...

**mahomedyaseenkhan**: did you hear my music?

I did. So,...

**anand\_m26blr**: Hi maho... I do. Heard you.\
**mahomedyaseenkhan**: hello!!!!!!\
**mahomedyaseenkhan**: was my singing nice\
**mahomedyaseenkhan**: must i sing more songs\
**anand\_m26blr**: A bit on the higher side, the pitch.

Now, you're probably wondering why I said that. Well, frankly, I heard a LADY's voice, and "**mahomedyaseenkhan**" sure is no lady. But heck, there's a whole lot of people who can sing at a lady's pitch, so I figured, fine. (The truth is revealed later.)

**anand\_m26blr**: The tune was good, though.\
**anand\_m26blr**: On the whole, yeah, I'd buy your album\
**mahomedyaseenkhan**: must i sing more song's\
**mahomedyaseenkhan**: can i sing more songs\
**anand\_m26blr**: You sure must!\
**anand\_m26blr**: Have you given a performance before?\
**anand\_m26blr**: Louder, please!\

**mahomedyaseenkhan**: im setting my band\
**anand\_m26blr**: OK, will await in rapt attention

I was being sarcastic, but the music that I heard was truly professional. I was convinced they guy was either operating a proper band, or was playing recorded music.

I wasn't kidding. I thought they were playing me some tape. Anyway, listening to original albums isn't my way of spending a weekend anyway.

**anand\_m26blr**: OK, boss, I've got to push now. Have to eat. Let's chat some other time...\

Needless to say, I took several months before I logged in.
