**funkymishti79**: no i want to stick to daddy and do what he does...\
**funkymishti79**: with the birds and bees\
**anand\_m26blr**: I don't think you can do what daddy does, sweety pie. A bird cannot do what a bee does.\
**anand\_m26blr**: (At least, not as well)\
**funkymishti79**: me a delhiwali and u....daddy (blinking eyelids)\
**anand\_m26blr**: Daddy has been all over the country\

**anand\_m26blr**: Moron!?!? That's not the way you speak to daddy, child! Now, spank yourself and\
**anand\_m26blr**: pretend daddy really beat you up.\
**funkymishti79**: kids r smarter these days daddy\
**anand\_m26blr**: And what's wrong with eating chocolates after brushing your teeth?\
**anand\_m26blr**: You can always brush it again after the chocolate\
**anand\_m26blr**: I'll go with you on the kids getting smarter. The time's come when I think I know\
**anand\_m26blr**: less than my 12-year old cousins.\
**funkymishti79**: lets get brushing outof the scene whats the use????\
**anand\_m26blr**: Point. All other things being equal, I'd rather never brush.\
**anand\_m26blr**: And, of course, hog all the chocolate and ice cream I can get.\
**anand\_m26blr**: But Daddy never said that, OK?\
**funkymishti79**: what do u do for a living daddy???? i mean i have to know the money source\
**anand\_m26blr**: well, OK, you might be a prodigy.

**funkymishti79**: no such luck...i am spoilt brat kinds\
**anand\_m26blr**: Daddy works as a consultant. And don't EVER ask what that means.\
**anand\_m26blr**: Daddy makes a life out of conning poor companies off their wealth.\
**funkymishti79**: smart daddy\
**funkymishti79**: naaaaa...me got a sis\
**anand\_m26blr**: Well, that makes me the proud father of two, then! Wonder when I got the time away\

**funkymishti79**: anand u r damn cute\
**anand\_m26blr**: With all due respect, I am NOT cute. I may be a hunk,\
**anand\_m26blr**: I may be powerfully attractive,\
**anand\_m26blr**: but I am NOT, repeat NOT, cute.\
**anand\_m26blr**: you promise not to call me "cute".\
**anand\_m26blr**: Such a ridiculous word.\
**anand\_m26blr**: Do you promise?\
**funkymishti79**: sorry daddy...i thought my daddy will be more appropriate\
**anand\_m26blr**: Hmmm.... that's better.\
**anand\_m26blr**: Just keep showing me this kind of respect, and I'll treat you to chocolates.\

**anand\_m26blr**: Nothing greedy about not wanting to be "cute"!\
**anand\_m26blr**: (Yuk, what a word!)\

**anand\_m26blr**: OK, OK, dear.\
**anand\_m26blr**: Incidentally, I know it's a little late to ask, but what's your real name?\
**funkymishti79**: daddy can call beti anything\
**anand\_m26blr**: Funky sounds too 'funky'. Mishti's better. OK, mishti?\
**funkymishti79**: yes daddy....as long as u feed me\
**anand\_m26blr**: Strict diet of chocolates and ice cream, I suppose? No way!\
**anand\_m26blr**: Daal chaval and roti is what you can expect.\
