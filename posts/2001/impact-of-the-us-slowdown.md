With the US economy slowing down, the need for technology workers [has dropped 44%](http://www.itaa.org/workforce/studies/01execsumm.htm). Those with [H1-B visas](http://www.ilw.com/lawyers/immigdaily/letters/2001,0329-H-1B.shtm), and [body shoppers](http://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/31/technology/31RECR.html), are facing the brunt.
