eBay will [delist items](http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1007-200-5813167.html) associated with Nazis, Ku Klux Klan, etc. Yahoo is cleaning its [porn content](http://www.cnn.com/2001/TECH/internet/05/02/yahoo.porn.ap/index.html). AOL is, however, using neural networks to [automatically filter content](http://wired.com/news/privacy/0,1848,43576,00.html).
