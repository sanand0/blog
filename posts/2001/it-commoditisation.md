The Economist suggests that just as focus of the computer industry shifted from hardware to software, it is now shifting from [software to online services](http://www.economist.com/surveys/PrinterFriendly.cfm?Story_ID=568249). Which means that the computer (hardware and software) will commoditize and only web services will make money.
