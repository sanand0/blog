Amitabh, Shyam and myself finally managed to see "Someone Like You" at **Sterling**. I arrived a bit early, at 10PM, and the show began at 10:45PM. The wait was well worth it, because it seemed to me that the who's who of Mumbai fashion were parading about the theatre. Not that I recognised anybody, but then, not that I **would** recognise anybody anyway. We got corner seats, unfortunately, with the AC directly above us. The three of us sat huddled in the corner, trying to warm ourselves. Fortunately, the movie proved a hilarious piece.
