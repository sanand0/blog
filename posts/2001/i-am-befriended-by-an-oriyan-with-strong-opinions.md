I just can't figure out some people. It's not just their English, which can be even more confusing than mine. It's just their way of thinking, I guess. This guy, for instance, started off with...\
**debasissatpathy**: hi friend i want a cool girl\
**root\_node**: I'm sure you do. Haven't found one yet, have you?\
**debasissatpathy**: no i have lots of girl friends not a lover\
**root\_node**: Too bad. Why don't you have a lover, though?\
**debasissatpathy**: i want a girl who will perfect matching for me\
**root\_node**: And what kind of a person is a perfect match for you?\
**debasissatpathy**: a sexy bold and friendly girl\
**root\_node**: That's it? And you'd fall in love with a sexy, bold and friendly girl?\
**root\_node**: (BTW, hope you're not trying to hook ME...)\
**root\_node**: I'm not a girl, FYI.\
**debasissatpathy**: he i am a girl try to hog me\
\
This floored me completely. I had no clue what the guy was saying. I figured he might have meant, "Hey, I am a girl... try to hug me!" -- so I figured...\
\
**root\_node**: Gosh, I'm chatting to a lesbian!!\
**debasissatpathy**: he i am not a lesbo i am intrest in your pennies\
\
Now, I'm completely clueless. "pennies"!?? Why's he interested in my money, and how's he going to get his hands on it? But then, it hit me...\
\
**root\_node**: Ah, I trust that would be a mis-spelling for the male organ of reproduction.\
**root\_node**: Nice thing to be interested in.\
