[I love chocolates](http://www.globalgourmet.com/food/ilc/). Especially white. When I went to Bangkok, every chocolate I bought was white:

> Toblerone: (Blue & white) Swiss Milk Chocolate with a White Chocolate Cream Filling and Honey and Almond Nougat\
> Lindt: Swiss Classic White Chocolate\
> The Belgian: 7 Seashells with Hazelnut Praline Filling\
> Ritter Sport: White Whole Hazelnut\
> Hershey's Chocolate: Cookies 'n' Creme Chocolate Cookie bits in White Chocolate\
> Hershey's Kisses: Cookies 'n' Creme Chocolate Cookie bits in White Chocolate
