**Earthquake**. We were in class this morning. We started off with 2 minutes of silence for the earthquake victims. At about 8:15AM, we felt a slight shake. We quickly ran out of the room and down the stairs. By this time, the tremors got fairly strong but they lasted only 7-8 seconds. At around lunch time, the estate officer said we were expecting more tremors at noon, so we lined up at the open air theatre, but nothing happened.

Incidentally, stand under a door in case of an earthquake. Or outdoors, of course.

Result: Sensex collapses, [cement companies](http://www.timesofindia.com/300101/30busi1.htm) stay firm.
