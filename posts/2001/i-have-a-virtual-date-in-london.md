**root\_node**: The reason I ask is, a couple of months ago...\
**root\_node**: this guy came over to this chat room, and asked\
**root\_node**: if there were "any Patels around"\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: lolz\
**root\_node**: He wanted to learn Gujrati, so he could impress his\
**root\_node**: GF, who was at college.\
**root\_node**: The best I could do was help him out with Hindi.\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: lolz\
**root\_node**: Hope the poor bloke never tried it out\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: hehe\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: he probably ended up gettin' a slap on his face\
**root\_node**: That would've been the start.\
**root\_node**: You ever slapped anyone? (Or got slapped?)\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: The guy's GF..." Tane Gujarati nati aavadtu!!! " \*SLAP\*\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: ooooh , that's neva been da case for me\
**root\_node**: What does that mean: "Tane..."\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: " You can't speak no Gujarati !!"\

**root\_node**: And why is that "neva been da case..."?\

**yours\_truly00\_2000**: but I wouldn't get slapped for that!\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: lol@ 3 times\
**root\_node**: No, actually, I've been slapped once after that.\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: really?\
**root\_node**: I was driving my scooter to college, and\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: who slapped ya?\
**root\_node**: I banged into this aayah who was crossing the road.\
**root\_node**: Not that I meant to, but...\
**root\_node**: And she slapped me so hard, that my glasses fell off!\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: awwww, u poor thing\

**root\_node**: Well, lots of people don't like consultants.\

**root\_node**: A consultant comes uninvited and tells you how many sheep you have,\
**root\_node**: and takes your dog, Etc. etc. etc.\
**root\_node**: BTW, which univ are you at?\
**root\_node**: A couple of my friends are at York and McGill\

**root\_node**: so she runs away, and a reporter finds her,\
**root\_node**: and he knows she's the princess, but she doesn't\
**root\_node**: know he knows, and they go around the city, while he secretly\

**root\_node**: princess has to go back, so he drops her at the palace,\
**root\_node**: and finally,.... no I won't tell you the ending.\
**root\_node**: It's just incredible!\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: :-O\

**yours\_truly00\_2000**: ;-)\
**root\_node**: Who's acted in it?\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: can u talk on da mic?\
**root\_node**: Nope. I'm at office, and the guy next to me is a bit paranoid about noises...\
**root\_node**: In fact, every time I'm on the phone, there's this\
**root\_node**: perpetual "hush hush" sound that he keeps making behind me!\
**root\_node**: Hey, Mary Poppins has Julie Andrews!! I didn't know that.\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: hey\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: u there??\
**root\_node**: Yup... you been getting my messages?\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: sorry , I got d/c\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: :-(\
**root\_node**: Are you on a dial-up\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: yea\
**root\_node**: Well, it sure is much faster than the dial-ups around here!\
**root\_node**: Do you chat often?\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: yeah , on da weekends\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: u ?\
**root\_node**: I started chatting every weekend...\
**root\_node**: but a couple of months ago, I met this person, with whom\
**root\_node**: I went out for dinner. In which she revealed herself, (amidst tears)\
**root\_node**: to be a chain smoker, alcoholic, drug addict, and a lesbian, and introduced me\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: :-O\
**root\_node**: to the gay DJ she was currently living with.\
**root\_node**: And there's court cases pending against her in 3 cities.\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: whoa\
**root\_node**: And I'd adopted her as my daughter on the Internet!!\
**root\_node**: So I've kind of taken to staying away from chat rooms, and trying to recover\
**root\_node**: (just kidding!)\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: LOL\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: that's crazy\
**root\_node**: I came online today to chat with a friend at SF. She wasn't around, though...\
**root\_node**: Yeah, it's crazy. But though I said it\
**root\_node**: in a funny way, (and it's true), poor thing was really confused.\
**root\_node**: Her father's a big-shot at SAIL. IIT-IIM and all that.\
**root\_node**: And she's got some problems at home, I think.\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: how old is she?\
**root\_node**: 21\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: k.\
**root\_node**: Strange, really.. how life can change some people.\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: yea\
**root\_node**: From what she tells me, she was nothing like this when she was a kid.\
**root\_node**: Hmm... how'bout you? What were you like when you were a kid?\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: you'd hafta ask mommy\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: hehe\
**root\_node**: And what might she say?\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: that I was a perfect angel\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: j/k\
**root\_node**: j/k?\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: just kidding\
**root\_node**: Ok,... which still leaves the "little angel's" childhood activities...?\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: I dunno\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: I think I was a good kid\
**root\_node**: I mean, what did YOU feel like when you were a kid?\
**root\_node**: Have you changed?\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: sure I have!\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: I'm not a kid anymore\
**root\_node**: In what ways?\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: ;-)\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: I'm more mature wit my ways\
**root\_node**: I'm told I was very cute and cuddly as a kid.\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: do you think you've changed at all from the age of 6 till now?\
**root\_node**: I kinda disagree. I look horribly fat.\
**root\_node**: Not that I don't right now... but I'd remove the horribly from it. And I'm not cute AT ALL.\
**root\_node**: But as for viewpoint, yeah, I've changed in some ways.\
**root\_node**: I don't know if I like it, though.\
**root\_node**: I still have the innocence I had as a kid. I trust everybody and everything.\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: :-)

**root\_node**: But I lost the carefreeness of childhood somewhere along the way, and am trying to get it back.\
**root\_node**: These days, I'm more cautious, more... sober, etc.\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: do u drink?\
**root\_node**: Nope. Do you?\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: na\
**root\_node**: Why not?\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: do u smoke?\
**root\_node**: Not that either. And I suppose you don't, too.\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: yea, neither do I\
**root\_node**: Why? Don't like it? Scared to? Never tried?\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: never tried it ... and never want to\
**root\_node**: I tried some wine, actually. Couldn't stand the taste.\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: well, a few drinks might be aiite\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: you don't like wine?\
**root\_node**: It tasted too bitter. It was red wine, I think.\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: i c\
**root\_node**: I stupidly bought it when I was at Paris, figuring that if I'm in France, may as well buy wines...\
**root\_node**: But neither I, nor my parents, nor my GF liked it.\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: kewl\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: r u a Maharashtrian?\

**yours\_truly00\_2000**: hehe\
**root\_node**: And if they're white, 2 kgs!!\
**root\_node**: I like ice-cream too. Actually, my favourite dish (varies, but mostly)\
**root\_node**: is hot apple pie with ice cream.\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: I hate white chocolate\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: it makes me feel as if I'm eating milk bars\
**root\_node**: Gosh! I disown you!!\
**root\_node**:\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: sowwie , but I don't like'em\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: hehe\
**root\_node**: Actually, I'm in a minority. Very few people I know like white chocolate.\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: ooooh, apple pie wit ice cream!!\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: I really want some dessert now\

**root\_node**: OK, there was this girl who studied with me at school.\
**root\_node**: And when I was in class 3, we had this play. The Sleeping Beauty.\
**root\_node**: She was the princess, and I was the prince.\
**root\_node**: The last scene (where the prince is supposed to kiss the princess) was\
**root\_node**: changed for our benefit, and in my case, I just got to put my hand on her head.\
**root\_node**: Her name's {censored}, and she grew up to be the most beautiful girl I ever laid my eyes on.\
**root\_node**: Till date, I never have gotten over the fact that it could've been me, giving her the first kiss!\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: aaaawwww, that's so sweet!\
**root\_node**: I lost touch with her for a long time.\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**:\
**root\_node**: It was only 6 months ago that I learnt from a friend that\
**root\_node**: she was working for {censored} at {censored}.\
**root\_node**: I hadn't even tried to get in touch with her for all these years,\
**root\_node**: just scared of what I'd say to her, and\
**root\_node**: stuff. I learnt that she's engaged. Now, here's where the irony starts.\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: she's engaged??\
**root\_node**: She's engaged to a guy named Anand. (My name's Anand.)\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**:\
**root\_node**: That Anand plays the keyboard really well. (So do I)\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: whoaaa\
**root\_node**: He's from IIM-A. (I'm from IIM-B.)\

**root\_node**: Naaah!!\
**root\_node**: That would've been too good to be true. But no.\

**yours\_truly00\_2000**: do u ever regret not keeping in touch?\
**root\_node**: Well... actually no.\
**root\_node**: I mean, for all that she was a wonderful girl and all that,\

**root\_node**: I mean, what kind of a secret would you LIKE to have?\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: I don't need secrets in my life\
**yours\_truly00\_2000**: My life's an open book\
