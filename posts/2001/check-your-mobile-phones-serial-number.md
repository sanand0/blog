A note from my friend Ashish: "To check your Mobile phone's serial number, key in the following digits on your phone:

`* # 0 6 #`

A 15 digit code will appear on the screen. This number is unique to your handset. Should your phone get stolen, you can phone your service provider and give them this code. They will then be able to block your handset. So even if the thief changes the SIM card your phone will be totally useless. If everybody did this, there would be no point in stealing mobile phones."

  The code works for certain providers. However, you can also go into your phone settings, and find "phone information" or something similar, and it will also give you the equipment serial number (ESN). Phones w/an IMEI, that's the same as an MSN or ESN (manufacturer's or Equipment). It depends on the network. Sprint, Verizon, Cricket, and Metro PCS all run on CDMA towers. Nextel runs on iDEN towers. T-mobile and AT&T run on unicel. Unicel towers are the most common worldwide, but CDMA are the most common in the US. This is why you can use a japanese at&t phone in the states, but can't always transfer it to the sprint network. They're designed and programmed to run on different towers.

  Hi. This trick is useless because if you've got a stolen mobile and its IMEI number is blocked by the service provider, there is still a way to use this handset. Reinstall the software of the handset and change the IMEI number too:)). In some countries, the person who does this job would ask the 50% amount of the handset for doing this job.
