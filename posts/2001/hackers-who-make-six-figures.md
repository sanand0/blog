If you don't believe in online theft, read the diaries of [hackers who make six figures](http://stacks.msnbc.com/news/550567.asp?cp1=1), or stores of [junk-mail hoaxes](http://www.latimes.com/business/cutting/features/lat_junk010503.htm). If you've already been had, share your sorrow at [Card cops](http://adcops.com/).
