The Fed [lowers interest rates](http://www.federalreserve.gov/BoardDocs/Press/General/2001/20010103/default.htm)! Certainly hadn't expected it till the end of the month. Obviously, since this is the first time they changed rates in-between policy meetings. The market was caught short too. Anyway, the NASDAQ has shot up. IT stocks in India are following.
