After telling Yahoo to remove Nazi memorabilia from its auction site, France is now considering [taxing computers and other recording devices](http://www.timesofindia.com/170101/17inte39.htm) to compensate artists for piracy. I mean, Paris and art is all fine, but this is crazy! And Germany's apparantly already done this.
