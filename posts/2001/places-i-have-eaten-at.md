I give up. I've been to too many places, like **Leopold Cafe**, **Tavern**, **Library Bar**, **Liquid Lounge**, **Roti**, **Not Just Jazz by the Bay**, **Buddy's**, **The Ghetto Pub**, **Crosswords**, **Groove**, **Asiatic**, **Hanging Gardens**, some Chinese restaurant at **The Leela** (which is the best Chinese food I've had), etc. And I don't have the time to write reviews! Maybe I'll take it up later.
