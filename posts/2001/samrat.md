I'd been to the **Samrat restaurant** (near Eros theatre) with Vinod. A bright and clean place, serving Gujarati cuisine. Having decided to try only new items, We picked **corn bhel** and **fried baby corn** for starters, and **makai nu shakh** with **reshmi paratha** and **rumali roti** for the main course. Makai nu shakh is "cream corn, cooked in milk with coconut, coriander and green chillis". It tasted rather like **Au gratin**, and rather nice, in my opinion. Corn bhel was excellent -- just bhel, except corn was used instead of puffed rice. Figuring there was too much corn on the plate, we had onion rings (instead of fried baby corn) which taste the same pretty much everywhere, I suppose.

The service is what really impressed me. The waiters were always there at the right times, invisible when they weren't needed, taking orders instantly, clearing plates at the right moments, and so on. Given all this, and that our meal cost Rs. 283, it's a great place to eat.
