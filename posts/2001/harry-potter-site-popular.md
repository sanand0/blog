The Harry Potter site is becoming [quite popular](http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1005-202-7827501.html). But what I don't get is the comment on CNet saying "Females made up 63 percent of the site's audience, **while males accounted for more than 37 percent**." Hmm... what were they expecting? Martians?
