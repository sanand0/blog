MIT's [Blogdex](http://blogdex.media.mit.edu/) crawls weblogs (like mine) for popular links. Nice concept -- somewhat like Google's, except more "current information" based. The [page of only weblogs](http://www.jjg.net/portal/tpoowl.html) has a good list of weblogs (not as comprehensive as [Eatonweb](http://portal.eatonweb.com/)), and Rebecca's written a good [history of weblogs](http://www.rebeccablood.net/essays/weblog_history.html).
