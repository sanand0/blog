Freedrive closes [public storage space](http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1005-201-4565328-0.html). Along with [Napster](http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1005-200-2895878.html), that's a nail in the coffin of free software. But what about the argument that [code is speech](http://cryptome.org/mpaa-v-2600-bac.htm), and hence "free speech"?
