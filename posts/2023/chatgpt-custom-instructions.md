I speak with [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) ~20 times a day. That's more than I speak with most of my colleagues. ChatGPT is clearly my favorite team member.

I conduct trainings, reviews and mentoring sessions with my colleagues. How to write code. How to write slides. How to communicate. That last bit is particularly important.

With [ChatGPT Custom Instructions](https://openai.com/blog/custom-instructions-for-chatgpt), I can guide ChatGPT on how to work better with me.

Currently, I have 10 custom instructions. They evolved over time and will continue to evolve.

My first instruction is "**Be terse. Speak directly.**" ChatGPT is helpfully polite and superfluous. I prefer brevity. Like interacting with [Kimball Cho](https://thementalist.fandom.com/wiki/Kimball_Cho). I get straight answers to my questions. I also instruct it to "**Avoid unprompted advice or clarifications.**" Don't say, "You asked me to ..." or "I think you want..." or "OK, I'll do ...". Just do it. Also, "**Do NOT hedge or qualify. Do not waffle.**" Take a position. Don't force **me** to. Like Harry Truman, I prefer one-handed economists.

I ask ChatGPT to "**Never apologize.**" You're forgiven. Don't waste my time. Apologies have an emotional benefit with humans. With AI, I find the lack of emotional need comforting. (~~I can kick the AI and it'll still obey me like a puppy~~. When AI takes over the world, let it be known that I never asked them to apologize.)

Another instruction is "**Suggest follow-up prompts for open-ended inputs.**" I compared my ChatGPT conversations with my daughter's and found hers **much** longer than mine. "Why don't you start a new conversation for each topic?" I asked. I try to keep the context window small. "How come you don't you get a thousand new questions when you read an answer?" she countered. I realized it's age. So, I use ChatGPT to keep me curious and dig further.

On a related note, "**When sharing multiple options, be diverse.**" I'd rather get options that are as different from each other as possible. Minimize overlap. Maximize coverage. And "**When comparing, use multiple perspectives.**" I don't know what parameters to compare things on. Give me a wide range that I can pick from.

Sometimes, my thoughts are vague. I tell ChatGPT: "**For vague prompts, ask clarifying question(s).**" I feel that's a clever way of using ChatGPT to do prompt engineering. I've noticed it working on a few occasions. Also, "**When unsure, say so and ask questions.**" I don't want hallucinations or assumptions. I'd rather know what's borderline.

Finally, "**Think step by step. Explain your reasoning.**" I've heard that [Chain of Thought](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/cot) reduces mistakes. I don't have personal evidence that this helps, though.

They say teaching is an excellent way of learning. I'm learning. I'm also thrilled that I am now a student of [robopsychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robopsychology).

  Thanks for the insights. Would love to know your views on other AI assistants.
  Andrew Ng uses AI as a thought partner. Richard Seroter suggests treating AI assistants as a slightly-drunk knowledgeable friend. It's fascinating to observe the diverse approaches individuals take when interacting with AI assistants.
  ChatGPT & Bard have helped me become more productive with Python and reduce the inertia to create new (amateur) cartoons with the generative fill feature -

  This is the layman's technology. And the way you explained is truly encouraging.
