[In 2023, I made 3 resolutions](/blog/my-year-in-2022/):

1. **Run 50 experiments**. I managed 44 / 50. (Here are [some](/blog/category/experiments/)). Learnings: I need to improve planning (9), scepticism (6), and lateral thinking (4).
2. **Make 1 change a month in my environment**. [I managed 8 / 12](/blog/one-year-of-transforming-thoughts-by-changing-environments/). The largest impact was from meeting new people, working out of new places, and using new gadgets.
3. **Calendar integrity**, i.e. stick to my calendar. I succeeded over 95% of the time.

My most memorable events in 2023 were:

- [Straive acquiring Gramener](/blog/father-of-the-bride/).
- [LLMs taking over my world](https://chat.openai.com/).

In 2024, I plan to:

- **Compound long-term goals, daily**. I want fewer, bigger, more meaningful outcomes.
- **Hit 80 heart points, daily**. Cycling or swimming (not walking, on doctor’s advice.)
- **Be a better husband**.

I'll continue to:

- Experiment, like in 2023.
- Change environments, like in [2023](/blog/one-year-of-transforming-thoughts-by-changing-environments/).
- Read 50 books a year, like in [2023](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/38719689), [2022](/blog/books-in-2022/), [2021](/blog/books-in-2021/), and [2020](/blog/books-in-2020/).

I’m curious — what’s **ONE** thing you’d like to do in 2024?
