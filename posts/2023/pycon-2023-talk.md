My PyCon talks are a way for me to learn. I usually pick topics I don't know about.

But at PyCon India 2023 the organizers picked "Programming Minecraft with Python" - a talk I'd given before. So, I started exploring ways to game it.

(I like gaming things. It's boring otherwise. Once, Infosys had me write a 400-page document. I began each page with a letter that spells out a poem.)

Sanjeev Sehgal and I were discussing Hasbro Gaming Studios and how Gramener could help with Gen AI, which gave me an idea.

What if AI could generate code to play Minecraft?

So welcome to JNTU Hyderabad at 11 am tomorrow for "AI Coding & Gaming: Programming Minecraft with Python". I've no idea what'll happen 🙂
