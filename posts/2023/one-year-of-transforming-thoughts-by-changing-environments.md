![One Year of Transforming Thoughts by Changing Environments](/blog/assets/changing-environments.webp)

From [The Extended Mind](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42291479-the-extended-mind) I learnt that our environment shapes our thinking more than I'd expected. That we can arrange our environment to extend our thoughts.

In 2023, each month I changed something in my environment to see:

1. What does "changing my environment involve"? What can I change?
2. Will I succeed?
3. Does it affect my thoughts? Can I track this?

Here are the results.

- 🟢 **Jan. New desk orientations.** Rotated standing desk, settled on one direction. Impact: **LOW**. I don't know if my thoughts changed.
- 🟢 **Jan: New walking routes.** I explored new areas in Singapore, Hyderabad and Chennai. Impact: **MEDIUM**. Just seeing new shops, posters and layouts helped me think differently.
- 🔴 **Jan: New song genres.** I playlist-ed with several western genres, but listened only twice.
- 🔴 **Feb: New book genres.** I list 12 genres I dislike: Art, Chick Lit, Christian, Cookbooks, Gay and Lesbian, Horror, Music, Paranormal, Poetry, Religion, Sports, Travel. I didn't read any.
- 🔴 **Mar: Sleep over problems.** Sleep is a great way to solve complex problems. But I couldn't summon the willpower to "load" problems at night.
- 🟢 **Mar: New people.** I met a new person daily. Impact: **HIGH**. Meeting diverse people had the highest impact.
- 🟢 **Apr: New work places.** I worked out of libraries, cafes, school, parks, and offices. Impact: **HIGH**. New **complex** environments (like libraries) prompted new thoughts.
- 🟢 **Jun. Notes from podcasts**. I took notes rather than just listening. This helped me reflect and synthesize. Impact: **MEDIUM**. BTW, I listen mostly to [Cautionary Tales](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub21ueWNvbnRlbnQuY29tL2QvcGxheWxpc3QvZTczYzk5OGUtNmU2MC00MzJmLTg2MTAtYWUyMTAxNDBjNWIxL2MwYWU4YzZlLTIyZjAtNGU5Yi1hYzFjLWFlMzkwMDM3YWM1My83ZjVhNDcxNC02YjEwLTRjY2YtYTQyNC1hZTM5MDAzN2FjNzAvcG9kY2FzdC5yc3M?sa=X&ved=0CBgQ9sEGahgKEwjQndfh6a6DAxUAAAAAHQAAAAAQuwE), [The Knowledge Project](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly90aGVrbm93bGVkZ2Vwcm9qZWN0LmxpYnN5bi5jb20vcnNz), [Hidden Brain](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS9rd1djMGxoZg), [How I write](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5tZWdhcGhvbmUuZm0vVEZURUUyNjA4NjUwMTM5), [The Seen and the Unseen](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9zZWVudW5zZWVuLmxpYnN5bi5jb20v), and [Deep Questions](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5idXp6c3Byb3V0LmNvbS8xMTIxOTcyLnJzcw).

- 🔴 **Aug: New cuisines**. I tried a Bibimbap, a Verdure Ciambatta, and then discovered my cholesterol problem. I stopped.
- 🟢 **Aug: New work habit**. I used Pomodoro with micro-tasks. Impact: **MEDIUM**. I became more aware of where I misestimate time and got less distracted.
- 🟢 **Nov: New exercise pattern**. I switched walking to cycling. This increases heart points, reduces foot stress, and gets me to work. Impact: **MEDIUM**. I switched from typing notes to dictating, which needs a different thought process.

In summary:

- 8 / 12 attempts were successful.
- New people, new places, and new gadgets had high impact on thoughts. Most others had at least medium impact.
- The changes mostly led to diverse thinking. But measuring that is subjective.

I'll continue exploring new environments in 2024. I'm evaluating:

1. New book genres (contd)
2. New music genres (contd)
3. Walking meetings
4. Reading while walking
5. New places to sleep (e.g. AirBnB)
6. Working while traveling
7. New audiences to teach
8. New attires

  Woowwww!! I always used to hear the popular suggestion "To change your life, you need to change your habits" - and I am now more convinced to the idea - if someone wants to change their life - they need to change what they hear, speak, watch or just break the pattern of what they have been doing all this time and I just realized thats what I am trying to do in my current situation of life and thats how I am evolving. I have changed my taste of music, replaced the series/films to new genre, replaced the books, replaced the articles. So, basically we don't need to leave the habits - we need to replace the habits - thats the crux!
