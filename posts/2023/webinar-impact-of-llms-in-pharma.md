Ashwini Mathur and I are conducting a webinar on the impact of LLMs in Pharma. It's online at 10 am Eastern on Mon Sep 11.

Simon Willison described LLMs as alien technology we're still discovering. I couldn't agree more - and it helps to see it from different perspectives. So, we're pairing the tech research at Gramener with the domain research Ashwini Mathur is doing at Novartis to explore the good, the bad, and the surprising uses of generative AI.
