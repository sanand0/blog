![Winning the alphabetical race](/blog/assets/alphabetical-race.webp)

Since my name (Anand) begins with "A", I used to get called on fairly early at school. In attendance. Answering questions. Classroom exercises. Quizzes. Even the distribution of test results.

A few people later told me that it is good training, since I'd always be prepared. (Maybe. I've no idea.)

At IBM and IIMB, [Ajit](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajitkmr/) was the only one ahead of me, alphabetically. Then he went a step ahead and named his son Aadi. I thought that's impossible to beat.

Today, we recruited [Aabhas Bharadwaj](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aabhas-bhardwaj/). I checked on LinkedIn. I can't find a **single** name on LinkedIn that's ahead of his, alphabetically.

So, does he win the alphabetical race? Can you find one ahead of his?
