Last week, I was at IIT Madras for lunch with the faculty.

The dessert was [carrot halwa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gajar_ka_halwa) with ice cream. I scraped the last bits with my spoon, but a little ice cream was left over.

I was torn. I **CAN'T POSSIBLY** waste it. But can I lick it? In public?

I don't have a problem licking at home. I lick my fingers. Plates. Bowls. Ladles. The cream on milk. The leftover milk in the glass. (If my tongue doesn't reach that far, I wipe it with my finger and lick the finger.)

That's why I like ice cream. It's **MEANT** to be licked. So are (in my opinion) cereals, savories, oats, honey, … It's a long list.

Licking is convenient. My fingers stay clean while I type. (Spoons are impersonal. I avoid them.)

Licking is efficient. I can have every last bit of food AND feel good about not wasting it.

Licking makes my dishwashing easier. (But it can be hard to tell if a dish needs washing.)

But most of all, that last lick **TASTES SO WONDERFUL**!

Before marriage, licking was fine. But my wife worried about my lack of civilized behavior and hygiene. So I've had a crash course over the last 20 years.

My current protocol is: don't lick when people can see you.

So, as I went to drop my plate, I looked around.

Now one was looking at me.

I licked a long lick on the plate.

It was **HEAVENLY**! Made my day.

  I can imagine the smile on your face after the last lick :-)

  This is very strong. Reminds me of the proverb of the cat drinking milk while keeping its eyes closed - in the "knowledge" that nobody can see it steal the milk.
  So maybe you can just simply close your eyes and lick!
