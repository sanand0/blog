In 2012, I [started Gramener with half a dozen friends](/blog/the-next-chapter-of-my-life/).

This week, we were acquired by [Straive](https://www.straive.com/), a part of [Barings Private Equity Asia](https://www.bpeasia.com/).

### How do you feel?

I feel like the **father of the bride**. Gramener was registered on 26 Feb. A day before my daughter's birthday. I've spent more time with Gramener than my daughter. That makes Gramener my elder child. Who's moving into a new household. Along with me. (I feel like [சகலகலா சம்மந்தி](https://ta.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%AE%9A%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%B2%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%B2%E0%AE%BE_%E0%AE%9A%E0%AE%AE%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%AE%E0%AE%A8%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%A4%E0%AE%BF).)

I feel **grateful**. I'm not good at business. But when my cousin remarked, "Anand, you're now giving a livelihood to over 250 people!" I was stunned. My co-founders, colleagues and clients built a thriving business and put **me** (of all people) as CEO in the middle of it. How do I even go about saying "Thanks"?

It feels like **joining college**. New people. Larger group. New ways of working and learning. Lots of topics to explore. Exciting and scary.

### What was it like?

Fundraising was rocky.\
We started in 2019. [COVID struck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19). We paused.\
We resumed in 2021. [Russia invaded Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine). We paused.\
We resumed in 2023. The [Israel - Hamas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Israel%E2%80%93Hamas_war) war started. Luckily, the deal was nearly done.\
I'm grateful [Naveen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/naveengattu/) ran the entire process like clockwork, taking all the stress. I'm the happy free-rider, as usual.

Starting up was **not** that rocky.\
We're **many**. With half a dozen co-founders, there are enough shoulders to cry on. That counts.\
We're **steady**. We didn't know how to blitz-scale, but we knew not to blitz-fail. Survival counts for a lot.\
We're **lucky**. This is basically the "I have no idea why we succeeded" category. Serendipity counts for a lot, too.\
[Ganes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gkesari/), [Mayank](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mayankkapurofficial/?originalSubdomain=in), [Naveen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/naveengattu/), [Ram](https://www.linkedin.com/in/j-ramachandran-2b51019/), [Ravi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ireddy/), [Vengatesh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/c-r-vengatesh-240126117/) -- yeah, it was fun. Not every day. But most of the time. It was fun.

### What will you do?

I'm part of Straive's data, analytics & AI business.

Straive extracts and analyzes all kinds of data. Financial. Legal. Research. Education. Pharmaceutical. There's a fair bit of converting unstructured data to structured. Exactly the kind of thing I love doing.

So, I'll be doing what I've been doing the last decade -- extracting insights from even more data and telling better stories from those.

I joined Gramener as "Chief Data Scientist". Now I'm debating "Data Storyteller", "Data Detective", "Data Psychologist", and a [few other evil titles](https://chat.openai.com/share/dc7ea33d-fef3-4035-a1ba-7cdd70225b75).

Wish me luck!

  Anand, all the best for your future endevaours. I am sure you would contribute well in Straive. So would Gramener still exist with its brand or from today it is Straive?
