<p>There was a time when workers were searched when they left, to make sure they weren’t stealing. They were paid by their hour, and had to clock in/clock out. They had supervisors to ensure that they didn’t slack off. They weren’t allowed to make calls at work. After all, people were lazy and thieving in those days.</p> <p>Nowadays, we’re enlightened. We respect and trust our employees. Like a family. We don’t micromanage their activities. We don’t tap their phone calls.</p> <p>We don’t restrict or monitor their web usage.</p> <p>Now, <em>your</em> company is enlightened, of course. Surely you can access these sites I believe <em>essential</em> for work? (If you work out of different offices, you should fill one for each office.)</p> <p>So, please tell me: which sites can YOU access?</p><iframe height="500" marginheight="0" src="http://www.s-anand.net/web-freedom-survey" frameborder="0" width="300" marginwidth="0"></iframe><p>(<a href="http://www.s-anand.net/web-freedom-survey?results=1">View results)</p>

  After being 10+ years in US, and now in India for the past few months, the restrictions on web access in indian IT companies is truly surprising (for the lack of a better word). Sucks!! It is primarily cause of folks who work here and have misused the freedom.

  there are no restrictions on web usage at my work location. The reason my HR said was that the company believe its employees won't be doing any bad thing with web and they gave full access to all employees.

  Currently where I am working there is proxy which prevents downloading exe files but rest all is open. I guess in today's world you should not restrict users on using web power. It can be uge source of knowledge
