<p>I’ve been going around setting up open source software a fair bit recently. To minimise the pain of explaining it, I’m putting together a short videos that explain the process.</p> <p>Here’s the first, on <a href="www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-windows.html">XAMPP</a>, which is a starting point for most open source applications. It bundles Apache (web server), MySQL (database), Perl and PHP.</p> <p>To install it, search and download “XAMPP for Windows”, and press enter for every question. Then install your application under C:\xampp\htdocs. That’s it.</p> <p><object width="600" height="475"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/cT0LwR1WmM8&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/cT0LwR1WmM8&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="600" height="475"></embed></object></p>

  Good one..
  Recently I had to install XAMP (no need for Perl, yet..) and I went with Windows Platform Installer. Found it much more simple and easy... http://www.microsoft.com/web/downloads/platform.aspx
