I’m totally hooked to [portable apps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_application) now. You don’t need admin rights to install them. You can run them off a USB stick. They won’t make your machine slower. All the reasons not to install an application vanish.

[PortableApps.com](http://portableapps.com/) is a good starting point. For what it’s worth, here are my portable apps by category (most used on top).

**Platforms**

- [Firefox](http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/firefox_portable). If you’re using IE6, please die. Lack of admin access is no longer an excuse.
- [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) brings you UNIX commands to Windows.
- [Portable Ubuntu](http://portableubuntu.demonccc.com.ar/) run Ubuntu as a window in Windows.

**Tiny utilities**

- [GDI++](http://drwatson.nobody.jp/gdi++/download-en.html) replaces the Windows font engine with a Mac-line rendering. Looks cool.
- [Clip](http://www.petri.co.il/software/clip.zip) is a command line tool that copies to clipboard. “dir | clip” copies the file listing to the clipboard. Outrageously useful.
- [PicPick](http://picpick-portable.en.softonic.com/) takes screenshots of the screen, windows, regions, whatever. And you can edit them too.
- [uTorrent](http://www.utorrent.com/) downloads torrents.
- [WinDiff](http://www.grigsoft.com/download-windiff.htm) compares two files and tells you the difference.
- [AlwaysOnTopMaker](http://www.fadsoft.net/AlwaysOnTopMaker.htm) makes any window stay on top of other windows.
- [DiskTT](http://www.snapfiles.com/get/disktt.html) tells you your hard disk (or USB stick) speed.
- [WinHTTrack](http://www.httrack.com/) downloads websites.
- [AllChars](http://allchars.zwolnet.com/) lets you type special characters like ½ by type Alt-1-2 or “ by Alt-`-`. It’s shockingly intuitive.
- [Restoration](http://www.snapfiles.com/get/restoration.HTML) lets you undelete permanently deleted files.
- [Windirstat](http://windirstat.info/) tells you what’s taking up space on your disk.
- [Sysinternals](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb842062.aspx) is a bunch of system monitoring utilities.
- [Virtual CD-ROM](http://download.microsoft.com/download/7/b/6/7b6abd84-7841-4978-96f5-bd58df02efa2/winxpvirtualcdcontrolpanel_21.exe) mounts .ISO files. You can use .ISO files without burning them.
- [Autostitch](http://people.cs.ubc.ca/~mbrown/autostitch/autostitch.html) stitches together photos to create panoramas.

**Media**

- [VLC](http://portableapps.com/apps/music_video/vlc_portable) plays any audio or video file.
- [TightVNC](http://www.tightvnc.com/portable/) lets you log into other machines like a remote desktop./li>
- [Audacity](http://portableapps.com/apps/music_video/audacity_portable) lets you record and edit audio.
- [CamStudio](http://camstudio.org/) lets you record video (screen capture).
- [VirtualDub](http://portableapps.com/apps/music_video/virtualdub_portable) lets you edit video.
- [MediaCoder](http://www.mediacoderhq.com/) converts audio and video from any format to another.
- [GIMP](http://portableapps.com/apps/graphics_pictures/gimp_portable) is like Photoshop. You can edit pictures.
- [Inkscape](http://portableapps.com/apps/graphics_pictures/inkscape_portable) lets you edit vector graphics.

**Servers**

- [XAMPP](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-windows.html) installs Apache, MySQL, PHP and Perl at one shot.
- [App Engine](http://code.google.com/appengine/) is Google’s freemium platform for app hosting.
- [Persevere](http://persevere.sitepen.com/) is a RESTful JSON app server that runs on Java.
- [Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/) is a JSP server.
- [nginx](http://nginx.org/) is a fast web server
- [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) is a RESTful JSON app server that runs on Erlang.

**Development tools**

- [Notepad++](http://portableapps.com/apps/development/notepadpp_portable) is my [current text editor](/blog/in-search-of-a-good-editor/). It has syntax highlighting, column editing, Unicode support, auto-completion, and is fast and free. So I dumped [Crimson Editor](http://www.crimsoneditor.com/).
- [Putty](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) is SSH for Windows.
- [Tidy](http://tidy.sourceforge.net/) cleans up HTML files.
- [CSSTidy](http://csstidy.sourceforge.net/) cleans up CSS files.
- [Processing](http://processing.org/) is a graphical programming language.
- [Wireshark](http://www.wireshark.org/) monitors network traffic.
- [Drip](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ieleak/) checks IE for leaks.
- [NVDA](http://www.nvda-project.org/) is a free screen reader.

Let me repeat:

- You don’t need admin rights to install these.
- You can run them off a USB stick.
- They won’t make your machine slower.

There’s really **no** reason whatsoever not to have them on a USB stick at least. They’re cheap.

  I have been using portableapps for more than an year now.Though the idea is to run it off a USB stick, this results in poor performance usually, especially for firefox.
- **Ganapathy** _13 Feb 2010 5:47 pm_:
  I landed in your site for analyzing IR songs.
  The collection of applications in www.pendriveapps.com seems to better than PortableApps.com (my personal opinion).
