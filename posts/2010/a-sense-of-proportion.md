A quote from [David Heinemeier Hansson](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YczGZCTPkRE#t=20m24s):

> So the problem is, a lot of business managers and especially business owners, they have no sense of probability. They can't fathom that concept. So They treat the probability of 1 to 10 trillion as the same as a 1 to a 100. And like, "We've got to deal with this 1 to a trillion probability, because, what if it happens?"
>
> No! Doesn't matter! I mean, don't care.
>
> So as soon as that sense of probability spreads, that people can treat that reasonably, I think all this nonsense just goes away.

This lack of proportion, sadly, is at the heart of my every day problems. (Just watch the video!)
