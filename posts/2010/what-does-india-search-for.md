<p>Over the last couple of years, I’ve been tracking the top 5 hot searches in India on Google Trends (<a href="http://www.google.co.in/trends">http://www.google.co.in/trends</a>). Here are the results:</p><iframe height="600" src="https://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=0Av599tR_jVYgdE5zTU5QWjcxVWVCaTBuY3d0NkUtc1E&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;single=true&amp;gid=0&amp;output=html&amp;widget=true" frameborder="0" width="600"></iframe> <p>If you're interested in making visualisations out of it, please feel free. But there's one particular thing I'm trying out, which is to categorise these searches and see if there's a trend around that. I've added a "Tag" column.</p> <p>Could you please help me tag the spreadsheet: <a title="https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0Av599tR_jVYgdE5zTU5QWjcxVWVCaTBuY3d0NkUtc1E&amp;hl=en_GB" href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0Av599tR_jVYgdE5zTU5QWjcxVWVCaTBuY3d0NkUtc1E&amp;hl=en_GB">https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0Av599tR_jVYgdE5zTU5QWjcxVWVCaTBuY3d0NkUtc1E&amp;hl=en_GB</a>  <p>It’s publicly editable, no special access required. If you could stick to the tags I already have (Business, Education, Entertainment, News, Politics, Sports, Technology), that would be great. If not, that’s fine as well.  <p>And if you’ve made any visualisations or done any analysis using this data, please do drop a comment.</p>
