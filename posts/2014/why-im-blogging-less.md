My blog’s been through a number of phases. Between 1996 – 1999, it was just a website with a few facts about my and some of my juvenile ramblings. Inspired by [robotwisdom.com](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorn_Barger), I converted it into a blog – except that I didn’t know what blogging was and just called it “updating my site every day.” It was mostly a link blog.

In 2006, around the time when I moved from Mumbai to London, I reduced my link-blogging and started writing longer articles talking about my experiences. This was a fairly productive phase, and I was churning a few dozen articles every year until 2012.

In the UK, I didn’t know many people, and wasn’t comfortable going out of the way to interact. My blog was the primary means of sharing my thoughts and work.

In 2012, when I moved back to India, that changed. I started speaking at various events. (Some of my talks are [recorded](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHCH16htawZbR_-mIqfGmYbhE5S2UckOh).) I’ve been speaking at one or two events every month, which is roughly the volume of blogging I was doing since 2006.

So, effectively, my output medium has changed. Instead of writing, I speak. Correspondingly, my blogging has come down.

How does it feel? Well, on the one hand,  there’s a lot more direct feedback when you’re speaking to an audience. You can interact with them, ask questions – all of which I can do on a blog as well, but this is real-time. When my audience laughs, I steer my talk more towards funny insights. When my audience claps, I steer it towards more impressive techniques. When my audience reacts like dead fish, I switch to Q&A. When my audience is lost in their own conversation, I terminate the talk early.

Effectively, my content is often shaped in real time. And that can be (usually) an exhilarating experience. I used to worry that the talks didn’t have the permanence of blog posts. But like I said, many of them are [recorded](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHCH16htawZbR_-mIqfGmYbhE5S2UckOh). I also worried that the audience response would not be permanent, like blog comments. But Twitter fills that void.

For example, yesterday, I was speaking at the [Great Indian Developer Summit](http://www.developermarch.com/developersummit/). Here are the tweets going out as I was speaking.

Apart from being able to preserve comments, I get to hear of this feedback a lot quicker than on a blog.

What I miss, though, is discoverability. When I blog, search engines index the content for anyone to find. I still get relevant comments on 15-year old blog posts. That, I suspect, will not be the case even for recorded talks.

But in any case, I’m afraid I will continue blogging less and speaking more over the course of the next few years. Please bear with me until then!

  My hunch was that since you started your own company, you are engrossed with lot of work. Thank you for the update, do continue blogging.
- **Shankar V** _30 Apr 2014 2:15 pm_:
  I do miss your blog posts though! :)
  I did check some of your youtube videos and and I liked the ones on data visualization quite a bit. I am working on a product that tries to grab relevant data from twitter feeds and use that as part of its forecasting functionality. I was able to gather some useful insights in those.
  Of course, my product does not need visualization techniques - like the ones you have used in your seminars. :)
- **Bargava** _15 May 2014 3:12 pm_:
  Really miss your interesting articles. Your talks are brilliant and interesting. It would be good if you would post some link articles/ talks that you attended/ presentations you did/presentations you found useful somewhere (preferably in this blog).
- **Vasudevan Panhavoor** _19 Feb 2015 4:16 pm_:
  Your talk today at Scope international was very interesting.opened lot of new windows of thought and insight.Thanks
