A couple of years ago, my HTC Explorer’s screen died. I bought a Micromax A50. This triggered a series of reactions prompting this post.

I have many defects. [Like most men](http://blog.xkcd.com/2010/05/03/color-survey-results/), **I can’t tell colours apart** – like the difference between pink and purple – and am constantly corrected by my six-year-old. **I can’t hear** two people at the same time – or even in-between each other. **I can’t find things** outside of my narrow field of vision. **I can’t recognise faces**, and need at least three one-on-one interactions before I place people. (If you ask me “Do you recognise me?” and I say “Yes, of course!”, I’m usually lying.) **I can’t place voices** on the phone. **My memory is terrible** – my wife’s learnt to make me write errands on my laptop. **I cannot identify cars** – in fact, I couldn’t drive until recently.

I also lack a fashion sense, despite being a keen student of design. I can understand rules of thumb, like how large line heights should be, or why high saturation colours are jarring. I can even give passable judgement on the quality of clothing.

The trouble is, I don’t see much value in it. I’m a utilitarian.

This post is an apology from all utilitarians like me. We’re sorry – we just don’t see the the point of a Mont Blanc pen or a Cartier watch. Our Bic pens and digital watches work just as well. We’re not saying you shouldn’t buy them. It’s just that we don’t understand **why** you would.

This is not an argument against expensive items. I bought the iPod and loved it. Same with the iPhone 4. I have two iPads. I’m fairly picky about the earphones I buy. The thing is, the reason I buy these is because there’s a value that matches the price. Where I don’t see the value, that’s just throwing money away.

So that’s why I travel in buses or autos. I can work on my laptop while someone else drives. That’s why I walk or climb stairs. I get to lose weight without wasting time at a gym. That’s why I don’t wear a watch and don’t subscribe to newspapers or TV.

For my non-utilitarian friends out there, this is from us utilitarians. Please forgive us. We don’t see the value.

  […] Anand on other hand is the calmest speaker I have ever seen. He brings out data driven stories which highlight issues, evoke emotions like surprise, laughter. Wish One day I can bring that finish to my delivery. […]

  VFM = Utilitarian and am happy being that.
  Instead of BIC its Reynolds pen, MicroMax vs Galaxy Y for me though I subscribe to newspaper and DTH (otherwise there will be revolt at home :D)

  What is the need to apologise?
  Or am I missing the sarcasm? :)
