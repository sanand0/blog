When you start typing in the address bar, Chrome suggests a link to visit, based on [frecency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frecency). What do my recommendations look like?

- A is for [airtel.in/smartbyte-s/page.html](http://airtel.in/smartbyte-s/page.html) – the page where you can check your bandwidth usage. I used to check it infrequently until I upgraded to a 125GB connection. Now I check it every few days and feel miserable that I’ve nowhere near used up my quota. This has coerced me to watch many Telugu movies, of which I don’t understand a word.
- B is for [blog.gramener.com](http://blog.gramener.com/) – I blog there on data stories. The last month or so has been fairly active thanks to the elections.
- C is for [calendar.google.com](http://calendar.google.com) – which has become primarily a **shared** calendar. It was always indispensible to manage my time. Now it helps my colleagues pick when to call me. Right now, my calendar has events booked about two months in advance.
- D is for [docs.google.com](https://docs.google.com/) – for effectively one single purpose: shared spreadsheets. This is such a common and powerful use case, and I’m surprised it hasn’t become much easier to use.
- E is for [epaper.timesofindia.com](http://epaper.timesofindia.com/) – some of our content has been published by The Economic Times, and I keep doing ego-searches in the print edition. But close behind is [eci.nic.in](http://eci.nic.in/) which I’ve been scraping a lot, and [election-results.ibnlive.in.com](http://election-results.ibnlive.in.com/ "http://election-results.ibnlive.in.com/") which we created for CNN-IBN.
- F is for [flipkart.com](http://www.flipkart.com/) – not [facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/). I’m not often on Facebook.
- G is for [gramener.com](https://gramener.com/). Naturally. (It’s not surprising that it’s not google.com: I search directly from the address bar.)
- H is for [handsontable.com](http://handsontable.com/) – a library that I’ve been using a lot recently, followed by [html5please.com](http://html5please.com/ "http://html5please.com/") that tells me which HTML5 features are ready for use.
- I is for [ibn.gramener.com](http://ibn.gramener.com/) – another property we created, but it only just beats [irctc.co.in](http://www.irctc.co.in/).
- J is for [join.me](http://join.me/) – a clean way to share your screen without the audience having to install anything (though you the sharer do have to install the software.)
- K is for [kraken.io](https://kraken.io/) – an amazingly efficient image compressor. As you might have guessed, I lead a strange life.
- L is for [learn.gramener.com](https://learn.gramener.com/) – our Intranet. Sorry, you can’t access this one.
- M is for [mail.google.com](https://mail.google.com/). I’ll probably be moving away from gmail as a backend this weekend to [Mail-in-a-box](https://github.com/JoshData/mailinabox/), though. Google’s pulling the plug on Google Reader has shaken my faith.
- N is for [news.ycombinator.com](http://news.ycombinator.com/ "http://news.ycombinator.com/"). When I’m bored and want to watch something while I have dinner, I don’t open YouTube. I open Hacker News.
- O is for [odc.datameet.org](http://odc.datameet.org/ "http://odc.datameet.org/") – the Open Data Camp. I’m quite into open data.
- P is for [pay.airtel.com](https://pay.airtel.com/ "https://pay.airtel.com"), but if you ignore the number of bills I pay, it would be [pandas.pydata.org](http://pandas.pydata.org/ "http://pandas.pydata.org/"), the home page of a remarkable data processing library.
- Q is for [quirksmode.org](http://www.quirksmode.org/), PPK’s remarkable browser-compatibility guide
- R is for [reader.s-anand.net](http://reader.s-anand.net/), my self-hosted RSS reader. It used to be reader.google.com, but Google let me down there.
- S is for [s-anand.net](http://s-anand.net/ "http://s-anand.net/") – this blog.
- T is for [twitter.com](https://twitter.com/). Unlike Facebook, I don’t dislike Twitter so much.
- U is for [underscorejs.org](http://underscorejs.org/ "http://underscorejs.org/"). Clearly I need to get a life.
- V is for [visualizing.org](http://visualizing.org/ "http://visualizing.org/"). They have a number of interesting data visualisations.
- W is for [webpagetest.org](http://www.webpagetest.org) – it helps measure the speed of web pages.
- X is for [xem.github.io](http://xem.github.io/ "http://xem.github.io/"). I’ve probably visited this page once, but it’s the only one in my recent history that starts with X
- Y is for [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/). I lied. I spend an order of magnitude more time watching Telugu movies on YouTube than on Hacker News.
- Z is for [zoemob.com](https://www.zoemob.com/en/). Again, a page I visited only once, but there’s nothing else in Z at the moment.
