A few years ago, I [ended up losting weight](/blog/my-weight-line/), mostly by dieting. That worked out rather well up to a point: I lost about 20kgs rapidly. But I ended up putting them back on almost as rapidly.

What I learnt from this was that dieting made me more short-tempered. It also reduced my metabolic rate. My body would adjust to the hunger and enter a “starvation-mode”, using the limited food ridiculously efficiently. So I’d have to eat even less to continue losing weight.

This time, I’m going to try it the slow way.

Firstly, my targets are moderate. I plan to lose about 1kg every month. (It’ll take me a few years to achieve my target. That’s good – it postpones the time when I’ll say “Ah, I’m thin. I can eat now” and become fat again.)

Secondly, I’m not going to keep myself hungry. I’m just going try to stop eating when I’m not hungry.

This happens for two reasons. One’s because I usually watch a movie when I eat, and keep eating until the movie’s done. The other’s because when I’m between activities, I raid the kitchen. It’s not realistic to pretend that I can curb these tendencies. But it’s possible to be a bit more aware of them.

Stocking the house with healthier foods helps. I also find that some fruits in particular keep my stomach full for longer. They’re [low value for money energy-wise](/blog/eating-more-for-less/), but great for dieting and health.

Thirdly, I’m going to start exercising, but in my own, slow, way. I’m not good at running or going to the gym, but weirdly, I rather like climbing stairs So the next step is to abandon lifts and only use the stairs.

None of these is a big step. But I’m not in a hurry, and these are more like habits I’d like to get into for the rest of my life rather than short-term measures.

Here’s to a lighter 2014!

  Good to see a blog post. I hope you get time to post often, specifically on things you are working on. If you are coming to Mumbai, post it. It will be great to meet you in person.

  Definetly Anand sir, I agree with you... rapidly loosing weight makes you short tempered. I have experienced it at personal level...

  Good to see you write after such a long time :D
  Taking the stairs is right option - I religiously follow at my apartment except when I am taking my kids up/down or have heavy load (weekly groceries etc.). At office post lunch I go down 5 levels, 10 min brisk walk and then climb up 5 levels. Well that has ensured my weight does not change much.
  Cheers to "Lighter 2014"!

  Great decision!!! Scientists say that when we feel hunger our stomach releases some acids which are helpful for digestion, If we eat without feeling hunger those acids will not get released and the eaten food would not be digested properly!!! All the best for your good health!!

  Moderate cycling might also help, may be a good bicycle that can help you to get around for normal chores would be a great way to achieve this goal.
