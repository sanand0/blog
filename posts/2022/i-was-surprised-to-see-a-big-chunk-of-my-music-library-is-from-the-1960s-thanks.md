I was surprised to see a big chunk of my #music library is from the 1960s -- thanks to the songs my parents grew up with, and passed on to me.

In celebration of Music Day on 21 Jun, I'm treating myself to 2 weeks of songs from the #1960s.

I've linked to my collection. Hope you discover some gems too!
