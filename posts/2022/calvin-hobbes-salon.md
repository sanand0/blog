<p>This is the Calvin &amp; Hobbes Hair Salon in Hinjewadi, Pune.</p>

<p>Calvin &amp; Hobbes fans might remember Calvin's hairdresser, Pete, who certainly "knows which side HIS bread is buttered on."</p>

<p>Maybe I too will go get "the top of my head shaved, and the sides dyed pink and cut in horizontal stripes" 😉</p>

<p>The signboard has a Tirupathi Namam drawn over the names of two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Calvin">famous</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hobbes">theologians</a> -- both of whom had great hair. That's a lot of hidden connections!</p>

<p>I was thrilled to see that it's not the only Calvin &amp; Hobbes salon in India. <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/BkVG7M2UQkMZUVZq7">Google Maps shows almost a dozen</a>! 😲</p>
