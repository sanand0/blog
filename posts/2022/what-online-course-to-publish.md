I'm planning to publish a 3-hour self-paced #onlinecourse.

But I don't know which topic would be more useful.

One topic is #datascience tools for non-programmers.

Another is a step-by-step guide to #datastorytelling for analysts.

What's more useful for you?

Could you share with people, so I work on the more useful course? (Thanks 🙏)
