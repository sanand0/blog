![My Year in 2021](/blog/assets/my-year-in-2021.webp)

[In 2021, I made 3 resolutions](/blog/my-year-in-2020/).

1. **Lose 10 kgs**. I lost 5 kg in 3 months. But gained it back by the year-end.
2. **Fail big**. I practiced confronting people – and failed. I still run from fights. Even when important.
3. **Calendar integrity**. I stuck to my calendar 90% of the time. But personal commitments slipped.

On **learning**, I discovered network clusters. My [PyCon talk on movie networks](https://youtu.be/vEvHq4qW3bk) is the start of a fascinating exploration of actors that [I’ll write more about](/blog/can-foreigners-enter-hollywood/).

On **training**, I designed a [Tools for Data Science Course](https://onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/course_pages/BSCSE2002.html) for IITM’s Bachelor’s in Data Science. I’m now a “faculty” at my alma mater, and no longer scared of it.

On **self-improvement**, I completed a [Landmark course](https://www.landmarkworldwide.com/advanced-programs/leadership-and-assisting-programs/introduction-leaders-program) and continued [Pranayama](https://www.artofliving.org/programs). Both helped my resolutions.

I also continued 2 habits from last year.

1. **Walk 10,000 steps daily**. I averaged 10,200.
2. **Read 50 books**. I read 52. [Here are my reviews](/blog/books-in-2021/). (Which did **you** like? What would you recommend?)

In 2022, I plan to:

1. **Run 50 experiments**. I’ll learn by disproving my beliefs with measurable tests.
2. **Speak at 10 global forums** on data stories, and spread the beauty of data.
3. **Be 10X more effective**. I’ll measure the impact and stop low-impact work.

I'm curious -- what's **ONE** thing you'd like to do in 2022?

  I'd like to learn native mobile development. I want to try out Flutter, Kotlin and Swift.
  I have been developing websites for the last 15 years. But those skills suddenly feel so outdated. The new hardware provides so many exciting opportunities. I'd like to explore them.
