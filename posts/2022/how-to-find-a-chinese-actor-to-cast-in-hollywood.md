![How to find a Chinese actor to cast in Hollywood](/blog/assets/chinese-actors-1.webp)

Film actors mostly act within their own industry.

For example, Hollywood actors act outside Hollywood just [10% of the time](/blog/can-foreigners-enter-hollywood/). Chinese actors act with non-Chinese actors just [1% of the time](/blog/how-isolated-is-bollywood-from-world-cinema/).

So, if you're a Hollywood producer trying to cast a Chinese actor, how would you find them?

One way is to list Chinese actors with the largest number of Hollywood co-stars. Let's see who tops that list.

## #5. Pei-Pei Cheng

She's an actress at the borderline of the Chinese - Hollywood clusters.

## More actors

Here are half a dozen more Chinese actors that have acted with Hollywood actors often.

<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000334/">![Chow Yun-Fat](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1ODkzMDU4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODk0MzY0._V1_UX214_CR0,0,214,317_AL__QL50.jpg)</a>

<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0945189/">![Simon Yam](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxNDUyNDEzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTk4NjAyOA@@._V1_UX214_CR0,0,214,317_AL__QL50.jpg)</a>

It's interesting to see that 3 of the top 6 ([Chow Yun-Fat](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000334/), [Pei-Pei Cheng](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0155607), and [Michelle Yeoh](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000706/)) had all acted in the blockbuster [Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0190332/) (2000).

So, perhaps the simple message to our Hollywood producer is to "look no further than the cast of the [first foreign-language film to break the $100mn mark in the USA](https://web.archive.org/web/20210507010851/https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/first-foreign-language-film-to-earn-over-$100-million-in-the-usa)."
