We inaugurated a new office in #Hyderabad.

10 years ago, I wrote on my blog: "I would create a small company that would probably fold. Then I’d do it again. And again, 10 times, because 1 in 10 companies survive. And finally, I’d be running a small business that’d be called successful by virtue of having survived. A modest, achievable ambition that I had the courage for.

Naveen Gattu, Mayank Kapur, Ganes Kesari, J. Ramachandran, Ravinder Ireddy, Vengatesh CR. -- we've come a long way 😃

Gramener successively crossed 10 employees, 10 clients, 10 years, $10 mn and is on its way to 10 offices.

I have the same request as 10 years ago.

It's scary but exciting. Please wish me luck!
