![Moving to Singapore](https://files.s-anand.net/images/2022-08-01-singapore-cbd-at-dusk.webp)

My family and I relocated to Singapore today.

Most of my major life decisions have involved the distance from Chennai.

In 1992, I wanted to study physics at IIT Kanpur or Kharagpur. My father erased the choices from my admission form and calmly said, "Tick anything in Chennai." I ticked everything except Chemical Engineering. [Prof Kalyanakrishnan](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/profile.php?arg=MTgw) saw my rank, said "You'll get Chemical Engineering", and ticked it for me. No one heard me say, "But I don't **like** Chemical Engineering."

In 1996, I got job offers from Ramco Systems, Chennai and IBM, Bangalore. I chose IBM partly because my mother said, "Move out of Chennai, else you'll live in your father's shadow."

In 1999, I got offers from IIM Ahmedabad and Bangalore. I picked Bangalore. "You're declining the best IIM?" my couseller asked. But it was far from Chennai.

In 1999, I lost a [scholarship](https://www.adityabirlascholars.net/) and was insecure during the internship interviews. I accepted my first offer (from [Lehman Brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehman_Brothers)), though it was in Tokyo. "Well, you've already accepted. All the best," my father said that evening with concern.

In 2000, I declined Lehman Brothers' pre-placement offer. Tokyo's too far from Chennai. (60 days of [Subway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subway_(restaurant))'s Veggie Delight didn't help.)

In 2001, my matrimonial profile mentioned just 2 things: "He likes curd rice and plans to settle in Chennai." My wife, Shobana, ignored it. She had other plans.

By 2005, she convinced me to move to the US or Europe. London's physically and spiritually closer to Chennai than New York or Seattle. So I joined Infosys Consulting in London.

By 2011, I'd had enough. After 2 months of careful planning, I walked home and told Shobana, "I lost my job. Please don't tell anyone. Let's go back to India." We [left 2 weeks later](/blog/the-next-chapter-of-my-life/) to join Gramener.

In 2019, I attended [Landmark's Forum](https://landmarkforum.com/) and told Shobana I'd tricked her. (She didn't speak to me for a day.) We decided to move again. Not the US or Dubai. Singapore's physically and spiritually closer to Chennai. She spoke to my father, who was OK to move too.

COVID slowed things down (thankfully), but in 2022, my daughter would start Class 11. That's a logical time to shift.

So as of 1 Aug 2022, we're in Singapore as a family. At least for 2 years, until my daughter starts college. After that, let's see.
