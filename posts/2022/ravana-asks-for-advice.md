Anand Madhav described this video as "Me, convincing tech lead to solve a problem on the weekend" 🙂"

For those who don't understand Hindi, here's a rough translation.

I've come for help. There's no one smarter at solving tricky problems. You're a wizard. You're strong AND smart. That's why I need your help.

I've used this strategy when reaching out. Praise does help.

But has it backfired on anyone? Any examples that you can share?
