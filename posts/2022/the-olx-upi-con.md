![The OLX UPI con](/blog/assets/Thief.webp)

Before [moving to Singapore](/blog/moving-to-singapore/), we listed our furniture and white goods for sale on [OLX](https://www.olx.in/).

### Caller 1: Vinod buys a bed

On 18th April, I got a call from +91 70868 17420. He said he was Vinod, and owned a furniture shop in Ahmedabad. He wanted to buy our bed for Rs 6,000.

It was not too bad an offer, so we agreed.

**Vinod**: "I will pay by phone, sir. Give me your WhatsApp number."

**Me**: (Wow! He's using [WhatsApp Pay](https://www.whatsapp.com/payments/in)? That's a first.) "Sure. It's 9741 552 552."

**Vinod**: "I've sent a picture, sir. Please scan that."

**Me**: "Uh... OK. I got this QR code on WhatsApp. I scanned it on PayTM. But it's asking **_me_** to transfer to 9713902265.imb@icici. Is that right?"

**Vinod**: "Yes sir. Please type 6,000 and send. You will get the amount."

He sounded so confident, I thought I had it wrong.

**Me**: "But this will pay _you_ Rs 6,000. How will I get Rs 6,000?"

**Vinod**: "Sir, it is a business account. I sent you Rs 6,000. But you will get it only if you enter 6,000."

**Me**: "Vinod, I don't think payments work that way..."

**Vinod**: "Sir, I will show you. I will pay you 1 rupee. You type 1 and send. You will get back 2 rupees."

I didn't mind losing a rupee, so I paid his account 1 rupee.

**Vinod**: "Sir, now please check your account. You will have 2 rupees."

And I did have 2 UPI credits of 1 rupee each from his account.

| Date        | Transaction Remarks                                                                             | Withdrawal | Deposit |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------- |
| 18-Apr-2022 | UPI/210885173447/NA/BHARATPE0990555/Yes Bank Ltd/PTMF7DD556B1DFF42538B3F24D52AFD0A0F/           | 1.00       |         |
| 18-Apr-2022 | UPI/210868024141/UPI Payment/9713902265.imb@/Axis Bank Ltd./ICId74ef953e7bd4588bbcf226880cd4864 |            | 1.00    |
| 18-Apr-2022 | UPI/210868024950/UPI Payment/9713902265.imb@/Axis Bank Ltd./ICIb8cafc942184402dafda89620319a9e9 |            | 1.00    |

**Me**: "Sure, Vinod. You paid me 2 rupees. But when I pay you Rs 6,000, there's no guarantee you'll pay me Rs 12,000. Why don't you come in person, collect the sofa, and pay me then?"

**Vinod**: "What sort of man are you? I already sent you money from my account. I cannot get it back now. I will have a loss. You tell me -- how will you give me back my money?"

**Me**: (Um... He really does sound convincing.) "Vinod, I'm really not comfortable with this. Let's not go ahead."

**Vinod**: "You're an asshole. Get off the line!"

### Caller #2: Gaurav buys a recliner

On 15th May, I got a call from Gaurav at +91 84865 47620.

**Gaurav**: "Sir, you have a sofa set on OLX for Rs 60,000. Can you give it for a lower amount?"

**Me**: "Well, I'm OK with Rs 55,000, but not less."

**Gaurav**: "OK sir. I will pay by UPI. Can I make a 50% advance payment, then you can take off the listing from OLX?"

**Me**: "OK, sure."

**Gaurav**: "What is your UPI account?"

**Me**: "9741552552@upi."

**Gaurav**: "I have paid Rs 27,500. I have sent you a picture. Can you scan it and enter 27,500?"

**Me**: "I got an image that requests a payment to bharatpe09905995207@yesbank.ltd. But that's for ME to transfer to YOU. I have not received your payment."

**Gaurav**: "I have already paid the advance sir. If you type 27,500 and send, you will get it."

**Me**: "Sorry, Gaurav, I'm not going to do that. Bye." (click)

By now, I was a _bit_ wiser.

### Caller #3: Priti buys a recliner

On 15th May, I got a call from yet another person. I forget his name. It might have been Priti.

**He**: "Sir, I want to buy your recliner. How much is it for?"

**Me**: "How will you pay and how much, please?"

**He**: "Sir, I will pay on UPI. I can pay up to 55,000, sir. I will transfer the money and send you the confirmation code, sir"

I let out a huge laugh, and continued laughing for a good 5 seconds.

**He**: "Sir, what happened, sir?"

**Me**: "Oh, this is so hilarious. How much money do you make in a month with scams?"

**He**: "Sir, what sir?"

**Me**: "I'd love to interview you for my blog. Do you change SIM cards often? Do you use channels other than OLX? What do you do in case someone files a cyber-crime complaint?"

**He**: (click)

  Haha. Thanks for sharing this.
  I went through exactly the same thing when I was relocating to Sgp too quite recently.
