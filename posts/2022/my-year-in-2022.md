![My Year in 2022](/blog/assets/new-year-2022.webp)

[In 2022, I made 3 resolutions](/blog/my-year-in-2021/):

1. **Run 50 experiments**. I ran ~20 until April (here are [some](/blog/category/experiments/)), but stopped (for no reason). I'll continue.
2. **Speak at 10 global forums**. I delivered 10+ [PyCon](https://pycon.org/) talks. They were pre-recorded, allowing me to scale. But recording videos and no feedback are boring. I'll explore how to scale enjoyably.
3. **Be 10X more effective**. I improved my [calendar effectiveness 2X](/blog/increasing-calendar-effectiveness-by-2x/) in Jan. But I realized this is actually efficiency. Not effectiveness. Maybe effectiveness shouldn't be optimized, but discovered. I'll continue to ponder.

Milestones in 2022:

1. I completed [10 years at Gramener](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sanand0_hyderabad-activity-6909797500946186240-sFF5) in February.
2. [I moved to Singapore](/blog/moving-to-singapore/) in August. ([Cycling](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/map/cycle.html) and [ComicCon](https://www.singaporecomiccon.com/) were mind-blowing discoveries.)

2 habits I continued from last year:

1. [Walk 10,000 steps daily](/blog/2-inches-will-change-my-life/).
2. [Read 50 books](https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/11636).

In 2023, I plan to:

1. **Run 50 experiments**. I’ll learn by disproving my beliefs with measurable tests.
2. **Make 1 change a month in my environment**. 90% of our thoughts are shaped by our environment. (Read [The Extended Mind](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42291479-the-extended-mind).) So I'll use the remaining 10% to **shape my environment**.
3. **Calendar integrity**. Stick to my calendar. Especially the time I block for myself to work. (This is a [2021 habit](/blog/my-year-in-2021/) I've slipped on.)

I'm curious — what's **ONE** thing you'd like to do in 2023?
