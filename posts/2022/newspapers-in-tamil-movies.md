![Newspapers in Tamil movies](/blog/assets/EEwciICUwAEACPZ.webp)

[Captain America: The Winter Soldier](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1843866/) shows a newspaper with the headline "[Howard and Maria Stark Die in Car Accident](https://twitter.com/movieheds/status/930588593969434624)".

The movie crew created a newspaper with a realistic font as well as text. It reads:

> Howard Star, founder of Stark Industries was confirmed dead this morning after suffering massive internal injuries from a fatal car crash. His Wife, Maria Stark, was also in the car ...

Tamil film crews use a less-expensive approach. In [Game - Oru Melliya Kodu (2016)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5543690/), I [noted](https://twitter.com/sanand0/status/1122156214043824129) that the [detective agreement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRWD68jYNIY&t=4758s) is titled "Partnership Agreement: Mr Akshay and Ms Maaya". But the contents talk about CorelDRAW and CorelPhoto

> Content is central to any project. Whether it's the perfect font, clipart, photo, a previous project, or a client mockup, CorelDRAW Graphics Suite X5 helps you quickly access content so that you can focus on your design.

Pity this movie crew didn't use CorelDRAW to create "perfect content".

In [Kee (2019)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7508630/), the Baasha virus has an [IP address of 181.589.214.739.023](https://twitter.com/sanand0/status/1145258583354777600).

In [Kolaigaran (2019)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9109794/), this newspaper article starts well:

> Hyderabad: Contract killer nabbed by Hyderabad police. A four member team executed the job. Kolavenkat, Chari team lead by Prabhakaran IPS.

... but the font changes mid-way, and so does the text. It goes on to say...

> This change of guard could be very important to Trump, almost 18 months into office, in the context of the fact that his political window of opportunity to put an enduring stamp on US foreign policy may soon narrow rapidly -- unless he wins a second term in 2020."

It makes perfect sense that Prabhakaran IPS would influence Trump's global policy. I'm just noting the typographical and grammatical errors.

I'm not sure if these errors are due to a lack of budget or attention to detail, but it certainly makes my movie-watching experience more fun!

In [Cobra (2022)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobra_(2022_film)), though, I did see an improvement. The Wikipedia page on "Dmitri Yugoslav" is a smart edit of the Wikipedia page on [Sergei Shoigu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Shoigu). Even the phonetic pronunciation of his name "Дмитрий Югослав" is correct.

On the other hand, the Telugu movie [Liger (2022)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4435072/) sported this YouTube screen. The upvotes rapidly increase from 1,380 to 1,430 -- but the number of views is stuck at "10 000 views".

[The Warrior (2022)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Warriorr) has a fax message with an order of suspension from the "Comissioner of Police" for the "Superintend of police" where "under ur regime as the superintend of police at kurnool havemisused your power ..."
