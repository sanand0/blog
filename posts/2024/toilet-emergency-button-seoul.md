I accidentally pressed the emergency button in the toilet.

I was smarter this time, unlike earlier. https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sanand0_chatgpt-llm-activity-7246836804249628672-5QXy/

I asked #ChatGPT which (unhelpfully) told me that "Typically, these buttons cannot be turned off".

I called the reception who couldn't understand a word of what I said. "Do you want water?" they asked when I told them "I pressed the emergency button in the bathroom.

So, I went to ChatGPT's advanced voice mode (I'm so grateful it was enabled last week) and said, "Translate everything I say into Korean.

Then I said, “I accidentally pressed the emergency button in the bathroom. I just wanted to let you know that there is no emergency.”

It very happily spoke out, in bold, loud Korean, "화장실에서 응급버튼을 실수로 눌렀습니다. 비상상황이 아니라는 점 알려려 드립니다.

The receptionist laughed, said, "Ah, OK, no problem.

The joys of AI!
