After 15 minutes of a hard struggle, I finally asked #ChatGPT "How do I open the thing that's closing the sink to allow the water to go down?"

Here's the thing with "maturity" (aka age, wisdom, experience, grey hair). It took me 15 minutes to realize I could use an #LLM to solve this problem. Despite me supposedly being an "LLM psychologist." I suspect the school children of today won't waste even a minute before checking ChatGPT.

On the other hand, if you DO know the answer to my question (without asking an LLM -- since ChatGPT gave me the perfect answer at a glance), I bow down to your wisdom and experience!
