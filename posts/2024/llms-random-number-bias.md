When picking a number between 1-100, do #LLMs pick randomly? Or pick like a human?

Leniolabs_ found #ChatGPT prefers 42. Gramener re-ran the experiment. Things have changed a bit. Now, 47 is the new favorite.

But Claude 3 Haiku latched on to 42 as its favorite. Gemini's favorite is 72.

See https://sanand0.github.io/llmrandom/

They all avoid multiples of 10 (10, 20, ...), repeated digits (11, 22, ...), single digits (1, 2, ...) and prefer 7-endings (27, 37, ...). These are clearly human #biases -- avoiding regular / round numbers and seeking 7 as "random".

Strangely, they all avoid numbers ending with 1, and like 72, 73 and 56 a lot. (I don't know why. Any guesses?)
