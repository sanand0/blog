About 7 years ago, Richie Lionell and Ramya Mylavarapu and a few others created Comicgen - an automated comic generation app personified by Dee ComicGen and Dey ComicGen

Ever since, we'd been exploring whether AI could replace it, and help non-designers draw comics.

Today, that became a reality for me with Recraft.ai.

Here is a picture of the original Dee. And a picture of the Dee crafted by Recraft with the prompt:

A simple line drawing of a woman with curly hair, wearing glasses, a short-sleeved white t-shirt, and black trousers. She's standing with her hands in her pockets, and has a slightly smiling expression. Her hair is quite voluminous and textured. The style is cartoonish and slightly sketchy, with uneven lines

(... which was generated by Gemini 1.5 Flash by passing it the original Dee's picture.)

We are finally at the stage where comic generation is truly available for the masses - at 8 cents via the API.
