About 7 years ago, [Richie Lionell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richielionell/) and [Ramya Mylavarapu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramyamylavarapu/) and a few others created [Comicgen](https://gramener.com/comicgen/) - an automated comic generation app personified by [Dee](https://gramener.com/comicgen/#?name=dee) and [Dey](https://gramener.com/comicgen/#?name=dey).\
\
Ever since, we'd been exploring whether AI could replace it, and help non-designers draw comics.\
\
Today, that became a reality for me with [Recraft](https://www.recraft.ai/).ai.\

Here is a picture of the original Dee.

And a picture of the Dee crafted by [Recraft](https://www.linkedin.com/company/recraftai/).

The prompt was:

> A simple line drawing of a woman with curly hair, wearing glasses, a short-sleeved white t-shirt, and black trousers. She's standing with her hands in her pockets, and has a slightly smiling expression. Her hair is quite voluminous and textured. The style is cartoonish and slightly sketchy, with uneven lines"

(The prompt itself was generated by Gemini 1.5 Flash by passing it the original Dee's picture.)

We are finally at the stage where comic generation is truly available for the masses - at [8 cents](https://www.recraft.ai/docs#pricing) via the [API](https://www.recraft.ai/docs#vectorize-image).
