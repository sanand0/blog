![The psychology of peer reviews](/blog/assets/peer-evaluation.webp)

We asked the ~500 students in my [Tools in Data Science](https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/course_pages/BSSE2002.html) course in Jan 2024 to create data visualizations.

They then evaluated each others' work. Each person's work was evaluated by 3 peers. The evaluation was on 3 criteria: Insight, Visual Clarity, and Accuracy (with clear details on how to evaluate.)

I was curious to see if what we can learn about student personas from their evaluations.

**15% are lazy.** Or they want to avoid conflict. They gave every single person **full** marks.

**4% are lazy but smart.** They gave everyone the **same marks**, but ~80% or so, not 100%. A safer strategy.

**10% are extremists.** They gave **full marks to some and zero to others**. Maybe they have strong or black-and-white opinions. In a way, this offers the best opportunity to differentiate students, if it is unbiased.

**8% are mild extremists.** They gave marks covering an **80% spread** (e.g. 0% to some and 80% to others, or 20% to some and 100% to others.)

**3% are angry.** They gave **everyone zero marks**. Maybe they're dissatisfied with the course, the valuation, or something else. Their scoring was also the most different from their peers.

**3% are deviants.** They gave marks that were **very different from others'**. (We're excluding the angry ones here.) 3 were positive, i.e. gave far higher marks than peers, while 11 were negative, i.e. awarding far lower than their peers. Either they have very **different perception** from others or are marking **randomly**.

This leaves ~60% of the group that provides a balanced, reasonable distribution. They had a reasonable spread of marks and were not too different from their peers.

Since this is the first time that I've analyzed peer evaluations, I don't have a basis to compare this with. But personally, the part that surprised me the most were the presence of the (small) angry group, and that there were so many extremists (with a spread of 80%+) -- which is a good thing to distinguish capability.
