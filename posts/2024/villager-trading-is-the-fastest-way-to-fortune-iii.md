[I asked o1-preview](https://chatgpt.com/share/671e50d9-212c-800c-9580-cdcd57bd616d) what the fastest way to get to a [Fortune III enchantment](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Fortune) was. My options were:

1. Using a [Fishing Rod](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Fishing_Rod) with [Luck of the Sea](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Luck_of_the_Sea) III + [Lure](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Lure) 3 and repeatedly fishing.
2. Using an [Enchanting Table](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Enchanting_Table) repeatedly until I get Fortune 3. Factor in the time that it would take to get the experience for these experiments
3. Making a [Villager](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Villager) a Librarian and breaking their [Lectern](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Lectern) and setting it up again

In short:

1. Fishing would take ~30 hours IRL
2. Enchanting Table would take ~1 hour IRL, even with efficient XP gaining methods
3. Villager trading would take ~18 minutes IRL

No contest.

Looks like my intuition was right about this.
