In my own, small, way, I now know how [Garry Kasparov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_versus_Garry_Kasparov) felt.

What's interesting is the progression of prompts it gives Dall-E to generate the images.

It begins with **"A simple drawing of a recognizable object, like a house, a tree, or a balloon, in a cartoonish style. The object should be clear and easy to guess. Minimal background details to keep it simple."** -- which were guessable.

When I asked it to make it harder, it didn't do so immediately. It just asked for **"A simple drawing of a recognizable object, like a boat, a car, or a kite, in a cartoonish style. The object should be clear and easy to guess. Minimal background details to keep it simple"** -- which was guessable too.

But after one round, it took the initiative to as, **"Want an even tricker one?"** and prompted **"A simple drawing of an uncommon but recognizable object, like a unicycle, a lighthouse, or a teapot, in a cartoonish style. The object should be detailed enough to identify but still minimalistic with minimal background."** Was it waiting one round to see if I really wanted a harder version?

Then it asked, "**Want me to up the difficulty even more?**" before prompting, **"A simple drawing of a very uncommon object, like an antique key, a gramophone, or a sundial, in a cartoonish style. The object should still be recognizable but with intricate details to make it challenging. Minimal background elements."**

When I asked it to "**Make it harder**" again, it went on directly to **"A simple drawing of an extremely rare and challenging object to guess, like a sextant, an astrolabe, or a vintage typewriter, in a cartoonish style. The object should be detailed enough to be identifiable but still maintain simplicity. Minimal background elements to keep focus on the object."** and then **"A cartoonish drawing of an abstract or rare object, like an ancient navigational device, a peculiar scientific instrument, or a mythical artifact, with intricate yet recognizable features. Minimal background elements to keep the focus on the object."**

That defeated me.
