Fascinating to see the how LLM cost-quality frontier moves. Recent fights were mostly on cost.

Yesterday, #OpenAI halved the GPT-4o cost. At $2.5/MTok (and with GPT-4o-min at 15 cents/MTok), the best and cheapest models are back with OpenAI, IMHO.

Sigh, time to move all our stuff back from #Anthropic. For now...
