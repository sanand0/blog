"Screen-scraping" takes on a more literal meaning."

Jaidev Deshpande and I scrolled through Twitter, recording the screen at 1 frame per second, and passed the video to Gemini 1.5 Flash 8b to extract all the tweets.

It worked well, and cost 0.04 cents.

Given its incredibly low image token count (~250 tokens / image) and cost (7.5 cents per million tokens), you can process 24 HOURS of video for just $1.62.

It's interesting how an economic shift can suddenly take us from a scarcity to an abundance mindset. I am now short of ideas, not budget, for video processing.
