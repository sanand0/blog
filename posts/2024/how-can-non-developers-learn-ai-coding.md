How can non-programmers build apps?

[Claude.ai](https://bolt.new/), [Replit.com](https://replit.com/), [Bolt.new](https://bolt.new), [V0.dev](https://v0.dev/), [Pythagora.ai](https://pythagora.ai/) and a few other tools write and deploy code just based on a prompt. You should try them out.

"But how do you build the skill? Is there a tutorial?" I'm often asked. No, I can't find a tutorial, but here is my suggestion.

1. [You probably can't guess what's easy or hard](https://xkcd.com/1425/). e.g. "Take my picture in black & white" is FAR easier than "When's the next lunar eclipse?"
2. So if the app doesn't work, try 2-3 times, then GIVE UP! Note it down. Then try something else. (You'll soon get a feel for what's possible.)
3. Revisit what failed 3-6 months later. It might suddenly become possible.
