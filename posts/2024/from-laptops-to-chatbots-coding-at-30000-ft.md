![From Laptops to Chatbots: Coding at 30,000 ft](/blog/assets/coding-on-a-flight.webp)

Until recently, I could code on flights. This year, I lost that ability. Again.

It's happened before. In each case, technology has solved the problem for me. Here's the history.

**I need a laptop.** Since 2001, I've never been without one on a flight.

**I need power.** Since 2005, I use dark mode and every low power feature available. (I also became good at finding hidden power outlets.)

**I need documentation.** Since 2007, I use offline documentation. Windows `.CHM`s gave way to [devdocs.io](https://devdocs.io).

**I need my notes.** Since 2010, all my notes (Markdown files) are synced via [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com/) automatically.

**I need CDNs.** Since 2014, I've replaced CDNs with local node modules. **Note to self**: Get a local caching proxy instead.

**I need GitHub.** Since 2023, I have two laptops. So, I `git pull` manually before flights. **Note to self**: Find an automated solution.

**I need ChatGPT.** Since 2024, I stopped coding without ChatGPT. Now I've forgotten how to code. Today, I couldn't figure out the SQL syntax to group by `duration == 0` vs `duration != 0`. **Note to self**: Get lightweight local code LLMs.

It's amazing how the coding technology stack has grown. Also amazing how technology fills the gaps in the scaffolding.
