How can non-programmers build apps?

Claude.ai, Replit.com, Bolt.new, V0.dev, Pythagora.ai and a few other tools write and deploy code just based on a prompt. You should try them out.

But how do you build the skill? Is there a tutorial?" I'm often asked. No, I can't find a tutorial, but here is my suggestion.

1. You probably can't guess what's easy or hard. e.g. "Take my picture in black & white" is FAR easier than "When's the next lunar eclipse?

2. So if the app doesn't work, try 2-3 times, then GIVE UP! Note it down and try something else. (You'll soon get a feel for what's possible.)

3. Revisit what failed 3-6 months later. It might suddenly become possible.
