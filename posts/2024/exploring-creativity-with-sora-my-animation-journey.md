I got access to [SORA](https://sora.com/) today. My first attempts was typical.

> An animated cartoon featuring Calvin, a young boy with spiky hair, standing in a playful boxing stance with oversized boxing gloves. He looks determined as he says ‘Bring it on!’ in a speech bubble. Facing him is Hobbes, a tall and slightly bemused tiger, also in a mock boxing pose with a gentle smile, as if humoring Calvin. The scene is set in Calvin’s backyard, typical of a Calvin and Hobbes comic, with a simple and uncluttered backdrop.

That looks **nothing** like Calvin & Hobbes. But there never was an animated Calvin & Hobbes anyway. (It's probably for the best.)

My second attempt was to recreate the [Fangorn Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treebeard).

> First person POV of a person walking through the woods in bright daylight, with the sum streaming across. He looks up and the trees gently crowd over, bending over him, darkening, darkening, … until there is no light.

The "darkening, darkening, ..." part clearly didn't make it.

At this point, I learned 2 things.

1. I lack creativity. (Not a surprise.)
2. If you don't get what you expect, appreciate what you get. These videos are pretty good!

So I decided to seek inspiration by copying. By exploring [SORA](https://sora.com/) gallery, I saw a lizard made of diamond. A man made of balloons, somersaulting. Santas made of jelly, dancing. Which led to asking ChatGPT:

> Build a creative list of video ideas with this structure: <NOUN> made of <OBJECT> <VERB>. For example:\
> Man made of balloons jumping.\
> Water bottle made of diamonds dripping.

This gave me quite a good list. Here are some creations.

Now that the constraints of reality are eliminated, wouldn't more of us explore impossible art more readily?
