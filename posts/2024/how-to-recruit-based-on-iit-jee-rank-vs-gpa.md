[Preserving this post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dan7geo_does-your-college-entrance-exam-rank-determine-activity-7254660050240090112--P3y?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) by Daniel George showing the IIT Bombay 2014 GPA vs JEE Rank on a log scale.

What I found interesting was:

- A higher JEE rank generally means you won't score too low, but you needn't score too high.
- The higher the JEE rank, the greater the spread of GPA.
- A high GPA can come from any rank (8+ GPA is uniformly distributed across ranks), but a low GPA is generally only from the lower rankers (6- GPA is mostly from 500+ rank.)

So, it's better to recruit based on GPA rather than JEE rank, unless you're going after the very best students (where it makes less difference.)
