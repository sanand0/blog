Arun Tangirala and I webinared on "AI in Education" yesterday."

"("Webinared" is not a word. But "verbing weirds language".)"

Mid-way, Jose Swan from the audience asked, "Can you summarise this session using an AI?

There are SEVERAL tools you can use to summarize talks. Whisper for transcription, FFMpeg for keyframe extraction, #NotebookLM for podcast generation, text-embedding-3-small for topic modelling, and of course, any regular LLM include #ChatGPT for summarization or translation.

I spent this morning applying those to the webinar video, and writing it up the process.

PS: I referenced Raj Vadigepalli midway and thought of Vivekananda Vedula, bringing back hostel memories from Indian Institute of Technology, Madras.
