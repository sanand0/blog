[Scope](http://www.research.microsoft.com/adapt/scope/details.htm) is an interesting new Microsoft technology. It lets you see your e-mail, tasks, calendar and alerts on a circular panel. The items are positioned by priority around the circle (centre is more important than periphery), and the shape of the item (circle, star, etc) determines whom it's from (work, family, only to me or to other people also, etc.) See their [demo](http://www.research.microsoft.com/adapt/scope/talk/scope_geometries_01.html) to get a better idea on how it works.
