Yet another example of the regulation doing the opposite of what was intended. The [CAS - Conditional Access System](http://www.rediff.com/money/2003/may/19spec1.htm) Bill was introduced to ensure that customers pay only for what they want to see (and hence, presumably, less than before). However, the customer is likely to pay 2-3 times as much. Of course, the other objective of making local cable operators pay their full dues is likely to succeed.
