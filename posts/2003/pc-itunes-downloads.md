[PC iTunes hits 1 million downloads](http://edition.cnn.com/2003/TECH/biztech/10/21/apple.itunes.reut/).

> Apple also announced a promotion with PepsiCo Inc. starting in February in which 100 million winning bottle caps on certain Pepsi drinks grant the winner a free song.

When I read that, I said, "That's 99 million dollars!"\
Then I said, "No, it costs just the royalty... which may be a fixed cost anyway."\
Then I figured, "Lots of people will buy Pepsi. Maybe Pepsi paid Apple for it."\
Smart move, Jobs.
