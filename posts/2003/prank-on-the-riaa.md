[Neat prank on the RIAA](http://www.zug.com/pranks/riaa/). Intruiging, though, about their contact address being hard to find. So I tried the same, by Googling RIAA

> First hit: www.riaa.org/index.cfm -> The Page Cannot Be Found\
> Second hit: www.riaa.org. No contact info on 1st page.\
> Tried "About us". No luck.\
> Searching for "contact" on the site gave 704 useless pages.\
> Google search for "contact" in www.riaa.org gives www.riaa.org/contact.cfm -> The page cannot be found

I give up. But this guy John Hargrave is good.
