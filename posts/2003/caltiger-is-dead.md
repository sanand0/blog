  Caltiger was a company which brought internet for common.. I don't know how and why it is dead, but it is... I was in class 7 that time when caltiger guys came to our school and gave us a floppy containing something , I was not having a computer at my home that time ... but one of my senior had it .. so he took it from me and used it .. and then returned it to me.. :) Now I know what he did with the disk and the password page... But whatever happened is happened.. caltiger must rise again.. I would love to support it once again

  We are indebted to India's first people's internet service. They will be legends forever
