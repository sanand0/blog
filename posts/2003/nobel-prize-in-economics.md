[Robert Engle and Clive Granger won the Nobel Prize](http://www.reuters.co.uk/newsArticle.jhtml?type=scienceNews&storyID=3579142&section=news) for their work on ARCH and something-or-the-other-I-ought-to-have-studied-at-B-school. I was outside Engle's office last month (somewhere within 100m of the corridor in the photo), and that's the closest I've been to an Nobel laureate. Of course, **some** people know him personally and discuss 'stupid problems' with him.
