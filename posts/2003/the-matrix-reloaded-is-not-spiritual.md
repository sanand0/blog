The most interesting [review of The Matrix Reloaded](http://www.capalert.com/capreports/matrixreloaded.htm) I've read, rating the film on spiritual grounds. Of course, the film does badly. Have a look at the "WISDOM" graph to the top-right of the page. The film barely makes a 'D' and half an 'M' on this scale.
