John Ashmead offers a view of quantum mechanics in which the [collapse of the wave function can be done away with](http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/quant-ph/0301016).

> Given that the world is emphatically quantum mechanical, there should be no separate domain of competence for classical physics. All classical results should ultimately be explicated in quantum terms.

I was long hoping this was the case.
