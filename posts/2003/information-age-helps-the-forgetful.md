[Information Age Intelligence](http://cobolreport.com/columnists/julian/01132003.asp) talks about how "... the information age ... opens up the opportunity for those with weaker memories to compete on a more even playing field than those with good ones." And it's the one of the best things that ever happened to me. [via andersja](http://www.jacobsen.no/anders/blog/archives/2003/02/26/intelligence_in_the_information_age.html)
