Good discussion on [inflation](http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/11/19/15483/620). Talks about how currency used to be a way of exchanging stuff, a way of storing value and a measure of wealth. Today, it's just a way of exchanging stuff. It's value keeps changing (inflation or deflation), so it's not much good for the last two.
