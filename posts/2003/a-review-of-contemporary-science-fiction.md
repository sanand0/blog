[A Review of Contemporary Science Fiction](http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/5/5/62620/94512) at kuro5hin. Of the authors mentioned, Orson Scott Card is the only one I've read. Neal Stephenson's [Cryptonomicon](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0060512806/?tag=sanand-20) looks interesting, though.
