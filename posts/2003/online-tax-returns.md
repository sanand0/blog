The most interesting part of [the budget](http://indiabudget.nic.in), for me, is the little line that reads "Electronic filing of returns". What that really means is that "the Income Tax Act is being amended to enable electronic filing of returns". Hope the [IT Department](http://www.incometaxindia.gov.in) puts this facility on their site by this year.
