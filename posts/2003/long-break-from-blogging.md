I've taken my longest break from this blog. Three reasons: work has been good, Age of Empires has been exciting, and the Web has become boring. But having heard from so many of you (thanks!), I'm going to continue the blog a bit. But I'm thinking of a new format, in the meantime. So please bear with infrequent posts till I get there.
