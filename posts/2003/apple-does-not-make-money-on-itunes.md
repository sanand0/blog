However, [Apple doesn't make money on iTunes](http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/33850.htm). It goes to the RIAA and credit card companies.

**Update: 24 Apr 2007** -- Looks like [Apple is making money on iTunes](http://www.macworld.co.uk/ipod-itunes/news/index.cfm?newsid=17845) after all. They've renegotiated agreements, especially with credit card companies, and make as much as 10 cents per song.

  it obviously does its a company from what revenue they get get say 1.5 B they would give alot to companies (who then takes some and gives it to the artists) and they're left with around 500 M and then thats what they earn
