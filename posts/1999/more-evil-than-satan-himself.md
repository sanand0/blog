Curious that [Google](http://www.google.com) should return Microsoft's home page when you search for "[more evil than Satan himself](http://www.google.com/search?q=more+evil+than+Satan+himself)"...

When I tried this on 24th June 2000, it didn't work. Maybe Google got smart. Or was it Microsoft?

On 3rd July 2000, it worked again.

  It's been fixed, Microsoft (and also Bush) were pretty mad at Google.
