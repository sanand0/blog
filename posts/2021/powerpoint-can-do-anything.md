I've a theory. PowerPoint can do anything. (Excel too).

Shape operations are especially powerful. In this tutorial, I create an address card icon and export it as SVG.

I don't need Sketch / Illustrator for this. They're great. But no, thanks. I'm pretty good with PowerPoint 😄

Have you seen PowerPoint do anything that made you go "Wow! This is cool!"? Do share. I'd love to hear about it.
