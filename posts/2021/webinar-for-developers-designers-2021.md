I'm running a #webinar for #developers & #designers on Thu 17 Jun. It's on creating data-driven infographics -- without much code.

This is based on new open-source #webcomponents Gramener is releasing - which makes it easy to map SVG attributes to data.

It'll be a light, fun workshop where YOU will build something.
