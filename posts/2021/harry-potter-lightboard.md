This is my first Lightboard video -- interacting with a data visualization on-camera.

Hans Rosling did something like this with BBC 4. That's been my inspiration.

In this video, I share the screen time of the Harry Potter supporting cast. The bar chart race was created in PowerPoint, and the lightboard effect was created with OBS. (I'll share a tutorial soon.)

What do you think of the video? Any comments? Questions?
