Comicgen now has a very versatile character -- Aavatar. Pick your gender. Hairstyle. Emotion. Attire. Pose. Colors. Create your own character. (It's open-source.)

The variations are staggering. It throws up surprising ones too, like crossdressers or bald women in sarees 🙂

What I'm struggling with is:

- Who needs this?
- What could they do with it?

I'm not sure. If you have ideas or know someone who might, please let me know 🙏
