For 10 years, I've enjoyed building data visualizations by writing code.

Today, we launched the Gramex IDE at https://gramex.gramener.com -- and it aims to make me redundant. Everyone can do the same, but without code.

I'll miss the good old days, but looking forward to a brave new world of low code.
