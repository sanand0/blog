The most under-rated #geospatial capability is spatial joins, IMHO. It lets you draw correlations from #geodata.

During the 2019 assembly elections in India, it allowed me to join voter data (by constituency) with religious population (by district) and show that BJP's vote share increased with Muslim population, while it reduced the AIMIM-allied JD(S) vote share.

That's just the start. We can explore:

- Where to open new schools?
- Where to locate bank branches?
- Does wealth lead to more or less theft?
- Does poor health lead to more or less pharmacies?
- ... and hundreds of other random questions.

My day job doesn't let me explore these much. I'd love to work with someone, though.

Would anyone like to explore such correlations? Which one(s)? I'd love to support you.
