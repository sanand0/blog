The #HarryPotter Screen Time video featured a bar chart race made in PowerPoint. Many of you asked how I made it.

Here's a step-by-step tutorial. https://youtu.be/E1SeoUV8awI

(BTW, there are just 9 people on LinkedIn who match "bar chart race" and #powerpoint. This is for you, friends!)

Gramener converted this feature into a product, SlideSense.ai. But more on that later 🙂
