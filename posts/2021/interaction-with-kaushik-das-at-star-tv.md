I had a lovely interaction with Kaushik Das at Star TV.

The goosebump moment for me was when he said, "... my boss called me the next day, and said that I've been playing with it since you showed it to me. And yeah, this is amazing! Why didn't we do this before?

Thanks, Star TV Network & Gramener teams, for your night-outs, weekends, and relentless energy -- and building a TV Rating #analytics platform you can be proud of.
