Contronyms are words that have two meanings that are the opposite of each other.

**Sanction**, for example, may mean restricting something (e.g. sanction against imports) or approving something (e.g. sanctioning imports).

**Scan** may mean to look at cursorily (e.g. scan a document) or look at in detail (e.g. scan an X-Ray)

**Fine** may mean excellent (e.g. fine wine) or average (e.g. the wine's fine).
