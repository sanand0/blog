When we started Comicgen -- a JavaScript library to generate comics - https://gramener.com/comicgen/ -- I didn't expect it to become the #1 page on the Gramener website.

Today, we had another unexpected surprise. The Comicgen Power BI plugin is a Power BI Editor's Pick: https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/power-bi-march-2021-feature-summary/

It's open-source: https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-US/product/power-bi-visuals/wa200001420. Try it out.
