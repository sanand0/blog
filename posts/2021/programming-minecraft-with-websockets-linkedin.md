Unofficial Guide to Programming Minecraft with Websockets.

My daughter got me hooked on Minecraft. (If you see me staring intently at you during a Zoom call, I'm probably fighting a mob.)

As it turns out, Minecraft is pretty programmable. You can send it messages using websockets that can place blocks, create mobs, get information, and more.

None of this is officially documented, though. So I spent a few weeks reverse-engineering this and put together a guide to programming Minecraft.
