<p>Some background scores just stay in your mind. Here is a tribute to 20 wonderful first interludes, dating from the 1980s to the 2000s. Can you guess which <i>movies</i> they are from? (My intention here is not to make this tough, but rather to let you enjoy the music. So hope to see most of you score 20/20)</p>

<p>Don't worry about the spelling. Just spell it like it sounds, and the box will turn green.</p>

  This is an awesome collection and also a wonderful job at your end. Anand neengal anadmaga vazha en vazthukkal. I thought the 14th song was Baba (it was sounding like Baba undan vasalile pala kodi pengal kathirukka...) But somehow got it wrong. Which one is that? Congrats again on a fantastic job...I have become ur fan. Thanks, Arun

  The ID3 tags on the songs are a giveaway for those who don't have a QT plugin inside their browser. Had to forcibly ignore my music player's window title ... Nice collection, btw (7 actually has the main tune). Arun, 14 sounds very similar to the Baba track, but the title says "Unnai Ketena", so I am curious too as to what it is.
