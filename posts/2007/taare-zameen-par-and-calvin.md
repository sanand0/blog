  Interesting! So we know who is the copy cat here :) BTW, I didn't know that you can just post a segment using Google Video..Is this something that can be done for Youtube videos as well.
- **Chittaranjan** _30 Dec 2007 12:00 pm_:
  Yeah! That whole "Math Problem" and the Cartoonic representation of it Immediately reminded me of 'Spaceman Spiff'.... I did look within my C&H archives for this strip but couldn't find it. Thanks for this now...
- **Tarun** _6 Apr 2009 12:27 pm_:
  yeah.... i realised it the moment the maths problem came in front of that fellow.

  God when will our people come up with our own ideas? Every movie and songs and albums have been a copy from some of the best in the Western countries. Sad on our education system that does not make us think out of box leading to such pathetic situation :(

  Maybe a little too late to respond here, but yup I did observe this too while watching the movie !
  I just choose to say God Bless Bill, not Aamir for stealing / approving the stealing and making money out of it. Did the so called perfect and creative guy credit Bill Watterson there ? I highly doubt that. It's a direct theft.
  P.S. : Big fan of your site.

  I remember a Looney Tunes cartoon about a boy that daydreams in class and has spaceman adventures during lessons. That must out date Calvin and Hobbes by at least a decade if not more.
- **Paul H** _5 Sep 2012 9:43 pm_:
  The Looney Tunes cartoons are A to Z-Z-Z-Z (1953) and Boyhood Daze (1957). The daydreams of Calvin are very similar to those of the Ralph Phillips character. I was off by a few decades. No doubt Bill Watterson saw these cartoons as a child.
