If you just want to check if you have new mail on Gmail, use [Google's personalised home page](http://www.google.com/ig) and [add Gmail to the homepage](http://www.google.com/ig/directory?q=gmail). This shows new mail and a few words as a snippet.

If you want to read your mail, and don't want to forward it to another account, use [Google Groups as a backup to Gmail](http://www.lifehacker.com/software/gmail/use-google-groups-to-back-up-your-gmail-account-248778.php). Create a private Google Group and forward mails from Gmail to it. Google Groups often is not blocked, even if Gmail is.

  Or you can use an web-based IMAP client ... http://roundcube.net/ looks like one.
