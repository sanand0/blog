I didn't realise the power of [Google Coop's custom search engines](http://www.google.com/coop/cse/) (CSE) until I watched [Scoble interviewing Google's Shashi Seth](http://www.podtech.net/scobleshow/technology/1266/googles-shashi-seth-has-your-custom-search-engine). In a nutshell, CSE lets you create a search engine that's focuses on specific sites, like [UK blogs](http://www.google.com/coop/cse?cx=014344395708352783254%3Aqyk2kmm852o) or [Photoshop sites](http://allynedmonds.com/tutorial-search/)

Anyone can create these. You can edit other people's search engines too. There are a [huge number of custom search engines you can volunteer to edit](http://www.google.com/search?q=volunteer+inurl%3Acoop%2Fcse+site%3Agoogle.com).

I've created a bunch of search engines myself:

- [Search my site](http://www.google.com/coop/cse?cx=000835481400639045115%3Aijf7y_3lm_w)
- [Search Calvin and Hobbes quotes](http://www.google.com/coop/cse?cx=000835481400639045115%3Aiyjyjb9bpfy)
- [Search for Indian torrents](http://www.google.com/coop/cse?cx=000835481400639045115%3Ae86_ywfdqic)
- [Search for Tamil mp3 files](http://www.google.com/coop/cse?cx=000835481400639045115%3Adbc_qq-ngpa)
- [Search for Tamil lyrics](http://www.google.com/coop/cse?cx=000835481400639045115%3Aadn5cfeousi)

You'll find that the Tamil mp3s and lyrics searches are very poor. This is because Google CSE does not show results in Google's "supplemental index" -- which has most of the useful results for MP3 searches. Fortunately [Google plans to add supplemental results](http://groups.google.com/group/google-co-op/browse_thread/thread/de6276f5e1c8f9ed/bcb3ca203de8357e).

You can improve these searches. Just click on the search link and click on "Volunteer to contribute to this search engine" at the bottom.

PS: I'm working on a [books search engine](http://www.google.com/coop/cse?cx=000835481400639045115%3Axj5d_vay7fo) as well, but until the supplemental index is added, there's not much I can do with it.
