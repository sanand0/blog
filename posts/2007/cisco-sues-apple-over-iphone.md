Firstly, views on the [Apple iPhone](http://www.apple.com/iphone/): great. Next impression: not so great. [You can't use it with your eyes closed](http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2007/01/10/the_five_bigges.html). And yesterday, [Cisco sues Apple](http://digg.com/apple/Cisco_Sues_Apple_Over_IPhone) for iPhone trademark infringement. In a [video on intellectual property, James Boyle at Duke Law School](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8538240380002213699#41m23s) says, when a company starts suing over intellectual property, it's a good time to dump their stock.
