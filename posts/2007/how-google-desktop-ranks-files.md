Google filed a [patent for Google Desktop](http://www.freshpatents.com/Temporal-ranking-scheme-for-desktop-searching-dt20070222ptan20070043704.php?type=description) last month, that hints at how they rank search results. Last access time, where the item is stored, file type and file size are mentioned as factors, but there are probably some more left unmentioned.
