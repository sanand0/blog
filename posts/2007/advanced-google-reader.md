I've stopped visiting websites.

No, really. There's only one website I visit these days. [Google Reader](http://reader.google.com/).

[![Google Reader screenshot](/blog/assets/flickr-google-reader_2114339813_o-png.webp)](/blog/assets/flickr-google-reader_2114339813_o-png.webp "Google Reader screenshot")

Google Reader is a feed reader. If you want to just catch up on the new stuff on a site, you can [add the site to Google Reader](http://www.google.com/support/reader/bin/answer.py?answer=70002). Anything new that is published on the site appears in Google Reader. Right now, I've subscribed to over 50 feeds. There's no way I can remember to visit 50 sites -- so I'm actually able to read more and miss less.

In a sense, that's the essence of using feeds to read stuff: **remember less, read more and miss less**. If I ever find an interesting site, I just add it to Google Reader and forget about it.

But it goes beyond that. **You can subscribe to search results**.

**Videos**, for examples. Subscribe to a search for [google engedu](http://video.google.com/videofeed?q=google+engedu&output=rss) on Google Video. Any new TechTalk at Google, you get it in your Reader. (The talks are fabulous by the way.) Or search for [hindi movies](http://video.google.co.uk/videofeed?q=hindi+duration%3Along&output=rss).

**Photos**? Track new photos of the [Indian cricket team](http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?tags=cricket,india) on [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/).

**Movies**? Get an update of the [latest movie torrents](http://www.mininova.org/rss.xml?cat=4) from [mininova](http://www.mininova.org/) or [torrentspy](http://www.torrentspy.com/). Or just get updates on [American Gangster DVDRip](http://www.mininova.org/rss/american+gangster+dvdrip/4).

**Presentations**? Track anything on [Javascript](http://www.slideshare.net/rss/tag/javascript) or [consulting](http://www.slideshare.net/rss/tag/consulting) from [SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/).

**Documents**? Find new eBooks on [Scribd](http://www.scribd.com/).

Not all pages offer a feed. But [Page2Rss](http://www.page2rss.com/) offers a reasonable solution. It converts pretty much any page into a feed.

It's gotten to the point where anything I **know** I want to read, I put it on Google Reader. The rest of the Internet is when I **don't know** what I want to read.

  I agree, RSS is great! Btw, you might also want to checkout Feedity - www.feedity.com for creating free custom RSS feeds.
