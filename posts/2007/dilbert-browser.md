[Al Donovan](http://pag.csail.mit.edu/~adonovan/) has created a [Dilbert repository](http://pag.csail.mit.edu/~adonovan/dilbert/) by crawling United Media's site every day since 1996. I've made them a little easier to navigate. [Click here to see the Dilbert Browser](/dilbert.html). Use the **left and right arrow keys** to see the next comic.

  Awesome. How did you do this?

  Hey Anand,
  The link doesnt seem to be working anymore (or, at least, its point to C&H, which I just don't mind, but remembered your Dilbert browser but could not find it anymore).
