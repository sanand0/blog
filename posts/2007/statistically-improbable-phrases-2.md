My earlier [list of statistically improbable phrases in Calvin and Hobbes](/Statistically_improbable_phrases.html) is technically just a list of "Statistically Improbable Words". I re-did the same analysis using phrases. Here are the top 20 statistically improbable **phrases** (2 - 4 words only):

[baby sitter](http://www.google.com/custom?cx=000835481400639045115%3Aiyjyjb9bpfy&cof=FORID%3A1%3BCX%3ACalvin%3B&q=%22baby+sitter%22) [chocolate frosted sugar bombs](http://www.google.com/custom?cx=000835481400639045115%3Aiyjyjb9bpfy&cof=FORID%3A1%3BCX%3ACalvin%3B&q=%22chocolate+frosted+sugar+bombs%22) [comic books](http://www.google.com/custom?cx=000835481400639045115%3Aiyjyjb9bpfy&cof=FORID%3A1%3BCX%3ACalvin%3B&q=%22comic+books%22) [doing homework](http://www.google.com/custom?cx=000835481400639045115%3Aiyjyjb9bpfy&cof=FORID%3A1%3BCX%3ACalvin%3B&q=%22doing+homework%22) [fearless spaceman spiff(](http://www.google.com/custom?cx=000835481400639045115%3Aiyjyjb9bpfy&cof=FORID%3A1%3BCX%3ACalvin%3B&q=%22fearless+spaceman+spiff%22)) [good night](http://www.google.com/custom?cx=000835481400639045115%3Aiyjyjb9bpfy&cof=FORID%3A1%3BCX%3ACalvin%3B&q=%22good+night%22) [hamster huey](http://www.google.com/custom?cx=000835481400639045115%3Aiyjyjb9bpfy&cof=FORID%3A1%3BCX%3ACalvin%3B&q=%22hamster+huey%22) [ice cream](http://www.google.com/custom?cx=000835481400639045115%3Aiyjyjb9bpfy&cof=FORID%3A1%3BCX%3ACalvin%3B&q=%22ice+cream%22) [miss wormwood](http://www.google.com/custom?cx=000835481400639045115%3Aiyjyjb9bpfy&cof=FORID%3A1%3BCX%3ACalvin%3B&q=%22miss+wormwood%22) [new year](http://www.google.com/custom?cx=000835481400639045115%3Aiyjyjb9bpfy&cof=FORID%3A1%3BCX%3ACalvin%3B&q=%22new+year%22) [peanut butter](http://www.google.com/custom?cx=000835481400639045115%3Aiyjyjb9bpfy&cof=FORID%3A1%3BCX%3ACalvin%3B&q=%22peanut+butter%22) [really think](http://www.google.com/custom?cx=000835481400639045115%3Aiyjyjb9bpfy&cof=FORID%3A1%3BCX%3ACalvin%3B&q=%22really+think%22) [slimy girls](http://www.google.com/custom?cx=000835481400639045115%3Aiyjyjb9bpfy&cof=FORID%3A1%3BCX%3ACalvin%3B&q=%22slimy+girls%22) [spaceman spiff](http://www.google.com/custom?cx=000835481400639045115%3Aiyjyjb9bpfy&cof=FORID%3A1%3BCX%3ACalvin%3B&q=%22spaceman+spiff%22) [stuffed tiger](http://www.google.com/custom?cx=000835481400639045115%3Aiyjyjb9bpfy&cof=FORID%3A1%3BCX%3ACalvin%3B&q=%22stuffed+tiger%22) [stupendous man](http://www.google.com/custom?cx=000835481400639045115%3Aiyjyjb9bpfy&cof=FORID%3A1%3BCX%3ACalvin%3B&q=%22stupendous+man%22) [sugar bombs](http://www.google.com/custom?cx=000835481400639045115%3Aiyjyjb9bpfy&cof=FORID%3A1%3BCX%3ACalvin%3B&q=%22sugar+bombs%22) [susie derkins](http://www.google.com/custom?cx=000835481400639045115%3Aiyjyjb9bpfy&cof=FORID%3A1%3BCX%3ACalvin%3B&q=%22susie+derkins%22) [watch tv](http://www.google.com/custom?cx=000835481400639045115%3Aiyjyjb9bpfy&cof=FORID%3A1%3BCX%3ACalvin%3B&q=%22watch+tv%22) [water balloon](http://www.google.com/custom?cx=000835481400639045115%3Aiyjyjb9bpfy&cof=FORID%3A1%3BCX%3ACalvin%3B&q=%22water+balloon%22)

That is, these are the 2-4 word phrases whose frequency in Calvin and Hobbes is substantially (at least 5 times) higher than in the other books I have.

While doing this, the single biggest problem that stumped me was: [what is a word?](/Splitting_a_sentence_into_words.html)

- Is "it's" one word or two words?
- Is "six-year-old" one word or three words?
- How do I distinguish between abbreviations (g.r.o.s.s.) and full-stops without a space ( ... homework.what's a ...)?
- Does a comma always split words? (It doesn't in numbers, like "3,500")

The other problem is, **phrases with more words are more improbable**. Right now, if a phrase occurs 5 times more frequently in Calvin and Hobbes than my other books, I include it. But three-letter words rarely occur that often, and four-letter words even less so. Maybe I should have a lower cutoff for longer phrases.

Anyway, this analysis is a crude first approximation. Clearly Amazon's gotten much further with their system.
