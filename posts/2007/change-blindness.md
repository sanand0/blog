A [cool psychology experiment](http://scienceblogs.com/mixingmemory/2006/12/coolest_experiment_ever.php). A student asks someone for directions. People carrying a door pass between them. Students switch. They check if the person giving directions has noticed that it's a different person. Many people don't notice the switch.
