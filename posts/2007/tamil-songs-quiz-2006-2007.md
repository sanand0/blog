<p>Here is the background music from some hit songs from 2006 and 2007. Can you guess which <b>movie</b> they are from?</p>

<p>Don't worry about the spelling. Just spell it like it sounds, and the box will turn green. (A couple of spellings are tricky. Try <b>J</b> instead of <b>S</b> and <b>V</b> instead of <b>G</b>.)</p>
