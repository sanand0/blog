[Running shoes may actually cause injuries](http://www.quickswood.com/my_weblog/2006/08/athletic_footwe.html). The heel has evolved to detect the pressure of hitting the ground, and to adjust the force with which to land our feet. Cushioned shoes soften the pressure. So we tend to land with greater force, creating more stress on our bones.

In fact, the more expensive the shoe, the more likely the injuries!

  Argh... this is crazy.\

  I have been running for the past year or so and recently shifted to Nike Pegasus because of the cushioning it provides. The whole article seemed like a rant. Will need to check the references he quotes before I can really believe this article.\

  That said, I will nevertheless try a bit of barefoot running as the article suggests and see if it really helps. Cheers, D.
