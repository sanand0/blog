An excellent talk about the [myths we hold on the developing world](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=4237353244338529080), supported by the most amazing graphics I've seen in a while. Among other things, the speaker (Hans Rosling) proves that chimpanzees are much smarter than the top Swedish students, and are slightly better than Swedish professors when it comes to knowing the developing world.

The first one of the series that I heard was the [TEDTalk by Sir Ken Robinson](http://www.ted.com/tedtalks/tedtalksplayer.cfm?key=ken_robinson). May be worth hearing all the [TEDTalks](http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=TEDTalks).

  i watched the presentaion. the animated graphics brings to life the trends hidden beneath the numbers which are otherwise so dull to look at.
