[Outsource your own job](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/769493.cms). A programmer outsourced his job to an Indian programmer. Salary arbitrage: $67,000 - $12,000 = $55,000. He's planning to get another job and do this again. (It's probably [not true](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.07/view.html?pg=2), though)
