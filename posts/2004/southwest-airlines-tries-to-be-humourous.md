Southwest Airline's [effort to be humourous](http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/8/26/1157/80793).

> Southwest ... have [my business] because of low fares, and force-marching their employees through comic routines will do little to affect my choice of carrier. They are, however, wasting their "research" dollars and undoubtedly humiliating their employees. I suggest they stop.
>
> While the phrases themselves were well-crafted specimens of humor, delivered with carefully practiced inflection of the voice, the eyes of the pressganged comedians were cold and dead.
