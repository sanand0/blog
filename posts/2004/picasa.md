[Picasa](http://www.picasa.com/) is good. I incorporated all my photos in it, and I can now search for photos of people by name. (I have catalogued my photos' file names with peoples' names.) Now, with Google taking over Picasa, we will soon be able to store/share photos on Google, and search across others' shared photos, using Google's image search!
