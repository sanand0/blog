Some interesting material on complexity that I found when hunting through the web.

> [Wired](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/5.09/newrules_pr.html): 12 principles of the networked world\
> [Trojan Mice](http://www.trojanmice.com/articles/complexadaptivesystems.htm): What are complex adaptive systems?
