[Mumbai Navigator](http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/navigator2/Main) from IITB tells you how to get from one place to another in Mumbai, using the local bus and train services. Also has maps. (Here's the [old Mumbai Navigator](http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/navigator/index.html).)

Alphonso has the full [Mumbai local train timetables](http://mumbainews.wordpress.com/2006/08/30/local-trains-time-table/) as pictures.

If you're looking for street maps, Google Maps has a pretty good [street map of Mumbai](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=mumbai,+india&ie=UTF8&z=13&om=1). But it's not as good as [MapMyIndia](http://db.mapmyindia.com/), which gives you the [driving route from Nariman Point to Bandra](http://db.mapmyindia.com/index.html?app=q%3Ddir%26from_addr%3Dnariman%2520point%252C%2520mumbai%26from_sta%3D%26to_addr%3Dbandra%252C%2520mumbai%26to_sta%3D&x=-1901298&y=5111996&z=9) for instance.
