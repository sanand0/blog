[A decade with Netscape](http://news.com.com/A+decade+on+the+Web+with+Netscape/2009-1032_3-5406640.html?tag=nl). I've been wavering between IE, Opera and Mozilla over the last few months, and have come a full circle.

> IE: Default browser. Works with BCG's intranet.\
> Opera: Great offline browsing. Fast downloading. Tabbed browsing. Mouse gestures.\
> Mozilla: Powerful plugins.\
> IE: [A9 toolbar](http://a9.com/). Fantastic way of searching.\
> IE again: [Google desktop](http://desktop.google.com/). Solves all offline browsing problems I had.
