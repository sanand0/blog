I take notes as I read or listen to books.

[Here are the notes.](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0t1kvbmlp1izu1r/AABQ8t7-J8eyKhP6CSqx1aoua?dl=0)

- They're mostly in Markdown.
- They're meant for me. They may not be as clear to you.
- They're often written on a mobile while I walk. They may have spelling mistakes.
