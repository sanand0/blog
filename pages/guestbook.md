  Interesting site.
  One observation...the fiction and non fiction books have 'Watch once' or 'watch many times' text alongside the book name.
  Thanks,
  Sumeet

  Very nice. Anyone who likes Calvin n Hobbes is ok with me. When that person is another Vidya Mandir alumnus, its even better. I also assume that IIT, IIM and LBS is up here not because you like these institutions.\
  Very nice blog.

- **Mahesh Shantaram (msram@techrose.org)** _1 Aug 1996 12:00 am_:
  Hi Anand! Rather than "new blog format", I would like to refer to it as the "classical blog format". The reason is that while Epiphany became a space for long, contemplative well-thought out posts, the need for a space where I can write short, quick quips
- **Mahesh Shantaram (www.techrose.org)** _1 Aug 1996 12:00 am_:
  Hmm... I find your blog to be made up in an interesting fashion, quite different from the ordinary. I like the single line entries and the selection of photo in the 'contact' box. And now to explore deeper...\
