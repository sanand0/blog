Find the best mutual funds to invest in over a 3-year horizon based on macro-economic factors.

```markdown
Research at the Indian and global macro-economic factors that affect such funds over a 3-year horizon.
Based on this, give me criteria by which to screen such funds along with a rationale.

Based on the above, evaluate funds that I can buy now.
Screen the top 10 I should evaluate based on these criteria.
Then, deep-dive into these based on the above criteria and rank order the top 3 I should buy.
Explain in plain, simple, layman terms why you picked these as the top 3.
Then, on the criteria based on which you picked these as the top 3, show a table comparing all (from which it should be obvious why these are the top three to pick.)

Think hard and deep. Think about possible risks, black swans, second order effects, ancient/timeless wisdom. Share a thoughtful and clear response.
