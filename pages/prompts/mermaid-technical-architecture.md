Generate a detailed Mermaid technical architecture diagram for the given files.

```markdown
Create a Mermaid architecture diagram for the files below.

Make sure that the diagram is rich in visual detail and looks impressive.
Use the "neutral" theme.
Name nodes and links semantically and label them clearly. Avoid parantheses.
Quote subgraph labels.
Use apt `shape: rect|rounded|stadium|...` for nodes.
Add suitable emoticons to every node.
Style nodes and links with classes most apt for them.

Follow that with a bulleted explanation of the architectural elements that is suitable for adding to a slide.

Finally, double-check the architecture against the codebase and provide a step-by-step validation report.
```

**Note**: The `architecture-beta` at https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/architecture.html is not nice enough
