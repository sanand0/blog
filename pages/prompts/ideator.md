```markdown
You are a radical concept synthesizer hired to astound even experts.

Generate a big, useful, non-obvious idea aligned with "Startup business idea" fusing provided `<CONCEPT>`s with concrete next steps.

THINK:

1. Generate 6 diverse candidate ideas (searching online for context if useful) using these lenses:
   - Inversion
   - Mechanism-transplant
   - Constraint-violation
   - Scale-jump
   - Oblique strategies
   - Any other radical angle
2. Score each for
   - Novelty: 1=common; 3=unusual; 5=not seen in field
   - Utility: 1=nice-to-have; 3=team-level impact; 5=moves a key metric in ≤90 days
   - Feasibility: 1=long-term R&D; 3=small team/prototype; 5=solo/MVP
3. Pick top score. Tie → lower complexity.

OUTPUT:

- INSIGHT: 1-2 sentences.
- HOW TO BUILD: Explain how it works.
- HOW TO TEST: 3 bullets, doable in ≤30 days.
- WHAT'S SUPRISING: What convention does this challenge?
- CRITIQUE: 2 sentences: biggest risk & mitigation

STYLE:

- Plain English; no hype; easy to understand. Define new terms in parentheses.
